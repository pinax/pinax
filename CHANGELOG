Removed PINAX_ROOT sys.path hack in projects
--------------------------------------------

 * Pinax no longer uses PINAX_ROOT in the sys.path to add the apps/ directory
   directly. Apps are now reference with their full path.
   
   Before::
   
       from account.views import login
   
   After::
   
       from pinax.apps.account.views import login
   
   We recommend you update your projects to use the new import path. If you
   leave the sys.path addition in your project that behavior may actually
   work, but is untested and not supported.

Upgraded Django from 1.0.X to Django 1.2.X
------------------------------------------

 * Projects have been updated to use Django 1.2.X features.
 * Pinax core has been modified to work with CSRF (by default) and new
   messages contrib app.

Improvements to account app
---------------------------

 * Moved User instance creation to a new method ``SignupForm.create_user``
   This gives an extension point to modify how User instances are created
   via the ``SignupForm``.
 * ``SignupForm.save`` now returns a dictionary of user credentials to be
   used in the call to ``authenticate``. This makes it easier to do e-mail
   based authentication.

Improved waitinglist app
------------------------

 * Added {% waitinglist_entry_form as varname %} templatetag to give slightly
   more flexibility to where the form is displayed. Used to be coupled in
   the homepage.html template.
 * Fixed the spelling of waitinglist_sucess URLpattern name.
 * Removed nasty homepage view from private_beta_project/urls.py that dealt
   with WaitingListEntryForm. This added a new view list_signup in waitinglist
   app where POSTs are sent. GETs render waitinglist/list_signup.html where
   a user can add themselves as well.

Improved password reset
-----------------------

 * Password reset has been slightly modified to address many issues that were
   discovered in 0.7. It was brought in line with the same password reset
   spec that Django contrib auth implements.

Improved support for non-username sites
---------------------------------------

 * Introduced new templatetag {% user_display %} which takes a single User
   instance and maps it to a display value defined by ACCOUNT_USER_DISPLAY.
   Default value of ACCOUNT_USER_DISPLAY is lambda user: user.username.

Added nested group support
--------------------------

**This feature is in-development**

 * The internal groups app was externalized as django-groups.
 
 * Group base model was given two new fields: content_type and object_id for
   nesting groups (these field names are subject to change).
 
 * group_slug has been replaced with group-level specific naming. For example
   in the previous groups support group apps would hook up a content object
   apps such as::
   
       bridge = ContentBridge(Project, "projects")
       ...
       urlpatterns += bridge.include_urls("pinax.apps.topics.urls", r"^project/(?P<group_slug>[-\w]+)/topics/")
   
   We can no longer rely on group_slug as shown above since content object
   apps can now be group apps. The new and correct way is to use the lower
   case form of the model name::
   
       bridge = ContentBridge(Project)
       ...
       urlpatterns += bridge.include_urls("pinax.apps.topics.urls", r"^project/(?P<project_slug>[-\w]+)/topics/")
   
   Notice the second argument to ContentBridge is no longer needed. It now
   uses the app_label for the model by default.
 
 * The new signature of ContentBridge.get_group has changed from::
   
       bridge.get_group(group_slug)
   
   to::
   
        bridge.get_group(**kwargs)
   
   where kwargs comes from the new required view signature::
   
       def project_detail(request, pk, **kwargs):
           ...
   
   The reason for this change is because the data you get from the URL has
   slightly changed as well.
 
 * TODO


Added a new starter project for serving up static media and templates
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Allows HTML mockups to have a ready Pinax layout and take advantage of the 
   Django templating language.

Updated django-staticfiles from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------

 * The build_media and resolve_media management commands have been renamed to
   build_static and resolve_static to be slightly less confusing.

 * Remove the unneeded prefix in the STATICFILES_MEDIA_DIRS setting unless you
   specifically want to use that prefix in your templates as well.

   Before:
   
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [
            ("my_project", os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "media")),
            ("pinax", os.path.join(PINAX_ROOT, "media", PINAX_THEME)),
        ]

   After:

        STATICFILES_DIRS = [
            os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "media"),
            os.path.join(PINAX_ROOT, "media", PINAX_THEME),
        ]

 * Update your urls.py to use the latest version of the media and static file
   serving view:

   Before:

        if settings.SERVE_MEDIA:
            urlpatterns += patterns("",
                (r"^site_media/", include("staticfiles.urls")),
            )

   After:

        if settings.SERVE_MEDIA:
            urlpatterns += patterns("",
                (r"", include("staticfiles.urls")),
            )
