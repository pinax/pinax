Contributing code, writing\ndocumentation, reporting bugs, as well as reading and providing feedback on\nissues and pull requests, all are valid and necessary ways to\nhelp.\n\n\nWatch the Videos\n\n\nEach month we do a Pinax Hangout, where we talk about a Pinax app or starter project, and demo how it works. Watching the videos of our \nprevious Pinax Hangouts\n might be helpful to you and might make contributing to Pinax easier. Click on the Youtube description of each video and you will find an agenda of what was discussed during a particular Hangout.\n\n\nQuestions/Help\n\n\nWhen you have questions or need help it\u2019s best to join our \nPinax project Slack channel\n and ping us there. It is also valid to create an issue and add the \nquestion\n label to it but it will usually take us longer to answer a question that has been filed as an issue than to help you in Slack.\n\n\nIf you provide us with an example of a bug you ran into, something that isn\u2019t working, something you don\u2019t understand, we will be able to help you much faster. It is totally sufficient to take a screenshot and post it in Slack or add it to your GitHub issue.\n\n\nReporting Bugs/ Requesting Features/ Making Pull Requests\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to create an issue or make a pull request on GitHub, please read \nthis blog post\n for help. If things are still unclear or you run into any problems, please don\u2019t hesitate to ping us in Slack.\n\n\nWhen you create an issue, please make sure to assign the correct labels to it. See \nthis blog post\n for help.\n\n\nCommitting Code\n\n\nThe great thing about using a distributed versioning control system like git\nis that everyone becomes a committer. When other people write good patches\nit makes it very easy to include their fixes/features and give them proper\ncredit for the work.\n\n\nWe recommend that you do all your work in a separate branch. When you\nare ready to work on a bug or a new feature create yourself a new branch. The\nreason why this is important is you can commit as often you like. When you are\nready you can merge in the change. Let's take a look at a common workflow:\n\n\ngit checkout -b task-566\n... fix and git commit often ...\ngit push origin task-566\n\n\n\nThe reason we have created two new branches is to stay off of \nmaster\n.\nKeeping master clean of only upstream changes makes yours and ours lives\neasier. You can then send us a pull request for the fix/feature. Then we can\neasily review it and merge it when ready.\n\n\nWriting Commit Messages\n\n\nWriting a good commit message makes it simple for us to identify what your\ncommit does from a high-level. There are some basic guidelines we'd like to\nask you to follow.\n\n\nA critical part is that you keep the \nfirst\n line as short and sweet\nas possible. This line is important because when git shows commits and it has\nlimited space or a different formatting option is used the first line becomes\nall someone might see. If your change isn't something non-trivial or there\nreasoning behind the change is not obvious, then please write up an extended\nmessage explaining the fix, your rationale, and anything else relevant for\nsomeone else that might be reviewing the change. Lastly, if there is a\ncorresponding issue in Github issues for it, use the final line to provide\na message that will link the commit message to the issue and auto-close it\nif appropriate.\n\n\nAdd ability to travel back in time\n\nYou need to be driving 88 miles per hour to generate 1.21 gigawatts of\npower to properly use this feature.\n\nFixes #88\n\n\n\nCoding style\n\n\nWhen writing code to be included in Pinax keep our style in mind:\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nPEP8\n there are some\n  cases where we do not follow PEP8. It is an excellent starting point.\n\n\nFollow \nDjango's coding style\n\n  we're pretty much in agreement on Django style outlined there.\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to enforce a few more strict guides not outlined by PEP8 or\nDjango's coding style:\n\n\n\n\nPEP8 tries to keep line length at 80 characters. We follow it when we can,\n  but not when it makes a line harder to read. It is okay to go a little bit\n  over 80 characters if not breaking the line improves readability.\n\n\nUse double quotes not single quotes. Single quotes are allowed in cases\n  where a double quote is needed in the string. This makes the code read\n  cleaner in those cases.\n\n\nDocstrings always use three double quotes on a line of their own, so, for\n  example, a single line docstring should take up three lines not one.\n\n\nImports are grouped specifically and ordered alphabetically. This is shown\n  in the example below.\n\n\nAlways use \nreverse\n and never \n@models.permalink\n.\n\n\nTuples should be reserved for positional data structures and not used\n  where a list is more appropriate.\n\n\nURL patterns should use the \nurl()\n function rather than a tuple.\n\n\nWhen callable arguments require multiple lines, place each argument\n  on a new line, indented four spaces as usual.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of these rules applied:\n\n\n# first set of imports are stdlib imports\n# non-from imports go first then from style import in their own group\nimport csv\n\n# second set of imports are Django imports with contrib in their own\n# group.\nfrom django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils import timezone\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\n\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\n# third set of imports are external apps (if applicable)\nfrom tagging.fields import TagField\n\n# fourth set of imports are local apps\nfrom .fields import MarkupField\n\n\nclass Task(models.Model):\n    \"\"\"\n    A model for storing a task.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    creator = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\n    modified = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\n\n    objects = models.Manager()\n\n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name = _(\"task\")\n        verbose_name_plural = _(\"tasks\")\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.summary\n\n    def save(self, **kwargs):\n        self.modified = datetime.now()\n        super(Task, self).save(**kwargs)\n\n    def get_absolute_url(self):\n        return reverse(\n            \"task_detail_with_a_super_long_url_name\",\n            kwargs={\"task_id\": self.pk}\n        )\n\n    # custom methods\n\n\nclass TaskComment(models.Model):\n    # ... you get the point ...\n    pass\n\n\n\nTesting your code\n\n\nPinax apps typically support several different versions of Python and several\ndifferent versions of Django.

We would like to enforce a few more strict guides not outlined by PEP8 or\nDjango's coding style:   PEP8 tries to keep line length at 80 characters. We follow it when we can,\n  but not when it makes a line harder to read. It is okay to go a little bit\n  over 80 characters if not breaking the line improves readability.
