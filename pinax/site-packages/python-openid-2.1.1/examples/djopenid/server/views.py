"""
This module implements an example server for the OpenID library.  Some
functionality has been omitted intentionally; this code is intended to
be instructive on the use of this library.  This server does not
perform actual user authentication and serves up only one OpenID URL,
with the exception of IDP-generated identifiers.

Some code conventions used here:

* 'request' is a Django request object.

* 'openid_request' is an OpenID library request object.

* 'openid_response' is an OpenID library response
