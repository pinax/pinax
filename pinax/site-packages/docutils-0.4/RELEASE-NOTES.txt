========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.4.x is the last version that will support Python 2.1.

   or later will be required.

   Docutils 0.4.x is the last version that will make compromises in
   its HTML output for Netscape Navigator 4.  Docutils 0.5 will
   require more up-to-date browsers (the exact definition is to be
   determined).

  extraction and reprocessing.
