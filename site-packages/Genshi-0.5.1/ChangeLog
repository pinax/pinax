Version 0.5.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.5.1/
(Jul 9 2008, from branches/stable/0.5.x)

 * Fix problem with nested match templates not being applied when buffering
   on the outer `py:match` is disabled. Thanks to Erik Bray for reporting the
   problem and providing a test case!
 * Fix problem in `Translator` filter that would cause the translation of
   text nodes to fail if the translation function returned an object that was
   not directly a string, but rather something like an instance of the
   `LazyProxy` class in Babel (ticket #145).
 * Fix problem with match templates incorrectly being applied multiple times.
 * Includes from templates loaded via an absolute path now include the correct
   file in nested directories as long if no search path has been configured
   (ticket #240).
 * Unbuffered match templates could result in parts of the matched content
   being included in the output if the match template didn't actually consume
   it via one or more calls to the `select()` function (ticket #243).


Version 0.5
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.5.0/
(Jun 9 2008, from branches/stable/0.5.x)

 * Added #include directive for text templates (ticket #115).
 * Added new markup transformation filter contributed by Alec Thomas. This
   provides gorgeous jQuery-inspired stream transformation capabilities based
   on XPath expressions.
 * When using HTML or XHTML serialization, the `xml:lang` attribute is
   automatically translated to the `lang` attribute which HTML user agents
   understand.
 * Added support for the XPath 2 `matches()` function in XPath expressions,
   which allow matching against regular expressions.
 * Support for Python code blocks in templates can now be disabled
   (ticket #123).
 * Includes are now processed when the template is parsed if possible, but
   only if the template loader is not set to do automatic reloading. Included
   templates are basically inlined into the including template, which can
   speed up rendering of that template a bit.
 * Added new syntax for text templates, which is more powerful and flexible
   with respect to white-space and line breaks. It also supports Python code
   blocks. The old syntax is still available and the default for now, but in a
   future release the new syntax will become the default, and some time after
   that the old syntax will be removed.
 * Added support for passing optimization hints to `<py:match>` directives,
   which can speed up match templates in many cases, for example when a match
   template should only be applied once to a stream, or when it should not be
   applied recursively.
 * Text templates now default to rendering as plain text; it is no longer
   necessary to explicitly specify the "text" method to the `render()` or
   `serialize()` method of the generated markup stream.
 * XInclude elements in markup templates now support the `parse` attribute;
   when set to "xml" (the default), the include is processed as before, but
   when set to "text", the included template is parsed as a text template using
   the new syntax (ticket #101).
 * Python code blocks inside match templates are now executed (ticket #155).
 * The template engine plugin no longer adds the `default_doctype` when the
   `fragment` parameter is `True`.
 * The `striptags` function now also removes HTML/XML-style comments (ticket
   #150).
 * The `py:replace` directive can now also be used as an element, with an
   attribute named `value` (ticket #144).
 * The `TextSerializer` class no longer strips all markup in text by default,
   so that it is still possible to use the Genshi `escape` function even with
   text templates. The old behavior is available via the `strip_markup` option
   of the serializer (ticket #146).
 * Assigning to a variable named `data` in a Python code block no longer
   breaks context lookup.
 * The `Stream.render` now accepts an optional `out` parameter that can be
   used to pass in a writable file-like object to use for assembling the
   output, instead of building a big string and returning it.
 * The XHTML serializer now strips `xml:space` attributes as they are only
   allowed on very few tags.
 * Match templates are now applied in a more controlled fashion: in the order
   they are declared in the template source, all match templates up to (and
   including) the matching template itself are applied to the matched content,
   whereas the match templates declared after the matching template are only
   applied to the generated content (ticket #186).
 * The `TemplateLoader` class now provides an `_instantiate()` method that can
   be overridden by subclasses to implement advanced template instantiation
   logic (ticket #204).
 * The search path of the `TemplateLoader` class can now contain ''load
   functions'' in addition to path strings. A load function is passed the
   name of the requested template file, and should return a file-like object
   and some metadata. New load functions are supplied for loading from egg
   package data, and loading from different loaders depending on the path
   prefix of the requested filename (ticket #182).
 * Match templates can now be processed without keeping the complete matched
   content in memory, which could cause excessive memory use on long pages.
   The buffering can be disabled using the new `buffer` optimization hint on
   the `<py:match>` directive.
 * Improve error reporting when accessing an attribute in a Python expression
   raises an `AttributeError` (ticket #191).
 * The `Markup` class now supports mappings for right hand of the `%` (modulo)
   operator in the same way the Python string classes do, except that the
   substituted values are escape. Also, the special constructor which took
   positional arguments that would be substituted was removed. Thus the
   `Markup` class now supports the same arguments as that of its `unicode`
   base class (ticket #211).
 * The `Template` class and its subclasses, as well as the interpolation API,
   now take an `filepath` parameter instead of `basedir` (ticket #207).
 * The `XHTMLSerializer` now has a `drop_xml_decl` option that defaults to
   `True`. Setting it to `False` will cause any XML decl in the serialized
   stream to be included in the output as it would for XML serialization.
 * Add support for a protocol that would allow interoperability of different
   Python packages that generate and/or consume markup, based on the special
   `__html__()` method (ticket #202).


Version 0.4.4
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.4.4/
(Aug 14, 2007, from branches/stable/0.4.x)

 * Fixed augmented assignment to local variables in Python code blocks.
 * Fixed handling of nested function and class definitions in Python code
   blocks.
 * Includes were not raising `TemplateNotFound` exceptions even when no
   fallback has been specified. That has been corrected.
 * The template loader now raises a `TemplateNotFound` error when a previously
   cached template is removed or renamed, where it previously was passing up
   an `OSError`.
 * The Genshi I18n filter can be configured to only extract messages found in
   `gettext` function calls, ignoring any text nodes and attribute values
   (ticket #138).


Version 0.4.3
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.4.3/
(Jul 17 2007, from branches/stable/0.4.x)

 * The I18n filter no longer extracts or translates literal strings in
   attribute values that also contain expressions.
 * Added `loader_callback` option to plugin interface, which allows specifying
   a callback function that the template loader should invoke whenever a new
   template is loaded (ticket #130). Note that the value for this option can
   not be specified as a string, only as an actual function object, which means
   it is not available for use through configuration files.
 * The I18n filter now extracts messages from gettext functions even inside
   ignored tags (ticket #132).
 * The HTML sanitizer now strips any CSS comments in style attributes, which
   could previously be used to hide malicious property values.
 * The HTML sanitizer now also removes any HTML comments encountered, as those
   may be used to hide malicious payloads targetting a certain "innovative"
   browser that goes and interprets the content of specially prepared comments.
 * Attribute access in template expressions no longer silently ignores
   exceptions other than `AttributeError` raised in the attribute accessor.


Version 0.4.2
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.4.2/
(Jun 20 2007, from branches/stable/0.4.x)

 * The `doctype` parameter of the markup serializers now also accepts the "name"
   of the doctype as string, in addition to the `(name, pubid, sysid)` tuple.
 * The I18n filter was not replacing the original attributes with the
   translation, but instead adding a second attribute with the same name.
 * `TextTemplate` can now handle unicode source (ticket #125).
 * A `<?python ?>` processing instruction containing trailing whitespace no
   longer causes a syntax error (ticket #127).
 * The I18n filter now skips the content of elements that have an `xml:lang`
   attribute with a fixed string value. Basically, `xml:lang` can now be used
   as a flag to mark specific sections as not needing localization.
 * Added plugin for message extraction via Babel (http://babel.edgewall.org/).


Version 0.4.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.4.1/
(May 21 2007, from branches/stable/0.4.x)

 * Fix incorrect reference to translation function in the I18N filter.
 * The `ET()` function now correctly handles attributes with a namespace.
 * XML declarations are now processed internally, as well as written to the
   output when XML serialization is used (ticket #111).
 * Added the functions `encode()` and `get_serializer()` to the `genshi.output`
   module, which provide a lower-level API to the functionality previously only
   available through `Stream.render()` and `Stream.serialize()`.
 * The `DocType` class now has a `get(name)` function that returns a `DOCTYPE`
   tuple for a given string.
 * Added frameset variants to the `DocType` constants for HTML 4.01 and XHTML
   1.0.
 * Improved I18n extraction for pluralizable messages: for any translation
   function with multiple string arguments (such as ``ngettext``), a single
   item with a tuple of strings is yielded, instead an item for each string
   argument.
 * The `HTMLFormFiller` stream filter no longer alters form elements for which
   the data element contains no corresponding item.
 * Code in `<?python ?>` processing instructions no longer gets the special
   treatment as Python code in template expressions, i.e. item and attribute
   access are no longer interchangeable (which was broken in a number of ways
   anyway, see ticket #113). This change does not affect expressions.
 * Numerous fixes for the execution of Python code in `<?python ?>` processing
   instructions (tickets #113 and #114).
 * The `py:def` (and `#def`) directive now supports "star args" (i.e. `*args`
   and `**kwargs`) in the function declaration (ticket #116).


Version 0.4
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.4.0/
(Apr 16 2007, from branches/stable/0.4.x)

 * New example applications for CherryPy and web.py.
 * The template loader now uses a LRU cache to limit the number of cached
   templates to a configurable maximum. Also, a race condition in the template
   loader was fixed by adding locking.
 * A new filter (genshi.filters.HTMLFormFiller) was added, which can populate 
   HTML forms based on a dictionary of values.
 * The set of permitted tag and attribute names for the HTMLSanitizer can now
   be configured per instance.
 * The template engine plugin now supports a range of options for
   configuration, for example to set the default serialization method, the
   default output encoding, or the default DOCTYPE.
 * The ElementTree adaptation function `ET()` has moved into the `genshi.input`
   module.
 * Allow `when` directives to omit the test expression as long as the
   associated choose directive does have one. In that case, the when branch is
   followed if the expression of the choose directive evaluates to a truth
   value.
 * Unsuccessful attribute or item lookups now return `Undefined` objects for
   nicer error messages.
 * Split up the `genshi.template` module into multiple modules inside the new
   `genshi.template` package.
 * Results of expression evaluation are no longer implicitly called if they
   are callable.
 * Instances of the `genshi.core.Attrs` class are now immutable (they are
   subclasses of `tuple` instead of `list`).
 * `MarkupTemplate`s can now be instantiated from markup streams, in addition
   to strings and file-like objects (ticket #69).
 * Improve handling of incorrectly nested tags in the HTML parser.
 * Template includes can now be nested inside fallback content.
 * Expressions can now contain dict literals (ticket #37).
 * It is now possible to have one or more escaped dollar signs in front of a 
   full expression (ticket #92).
 * The `Markup` class is now available by default in template expressions
   (ticket #67).
 * The handling of namespace declarations in XML/XHTML output has been improved.
 * The `Attrs` class no longer automatically wraps all attribute names in
   `QName` objects. This is now the responsibility of whoever is instantiating
   `Attrs` objects (for example, stream filters and generators).
 * Python code blocks are now supported using the `<?python ?>` processing
   instruction (ticket #84).
 * The way errors in template expressions are handled can now be configured. The
   option `LenientLookup` provides the same forgiving mode used in previous
   Genshi versions, while `StrictLookup` raises exceptions when undefined
   variables or members are accessed. The lenient mode is still the default in
   this version, but that may change in the future. (ticket #88)
 * If a variable is not necessarily defined at the top level of the template
   data, the new built-in functions `defined(key)` and `value_of(key, default)`
   can be used so that the template also works in strict lookup mode. These
   functions were previously only available when using Genshi via the template
   engine plugin (for compatibility with Kid).
 * `style` attributes are no longer allowed by the `HTMLSanitizer` by default.
   If they are explicitly added to the set of safe attributes, any unicode
   escapes in the attribute value are now handled properly.
 * Namespace declarations on conditional elements (for example using a `py:if`
   directive`) are no longer moved to the following element when the element
   originally carrying the declaration is removed from the stream (ticket #107).
 * Added basic built-in support for internationalizing templates by providing
   a new `Translator` class that can both extract localizable strings from a
   stream, and replace those strings with their localizations at render time.
   The code for this was largely taken from previous work done by Matt Good
   and David Fraser.


Version 0.3.6
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.6/
(Dec 11 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * The builder API now accepts streams as children of elements and fragments.


Version 0.3.5
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.5/
(Nov 22 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * Fix XPath traversal in match templates. Previously, `div/p` would be treated 
   the same as `div//p`, i.e. it would match all descendants and not just the
   immediate children.
 * Preserve whitespace in HTML `<pre>` elements also when they contain child
   elements.
 * Match templates no longer match their own output (ticket #77).
 * Blank lines before directives in text templates are now preserved as
   expected (ticket #62).


Version 0.3.4
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.4/
(Nov 2 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * The encoding of HTML and XML files, as well as markup and text templates,
   can now be specified. Also, the encoding specified in XML declarations is
   now respected unless an expiclit encoding is requested.
 * Expressions used as arguments for `py:with`, `py:def`, and `py:for`
   directives can now contain non-ASCII strings.


Version 0.3.3
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.3/
(Oct 16 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * Fixed bug introduced in 0.3.2 that broke the parsing of templates which
   declare the same namespace more than once in a nested fashion.
 * Fixed the parsing of HTML entity references inside attribute values, both
   in the `XMLParser` and the `HTMLParser` classes.
 * Some changes to usage of absolute vs. relative template paths to ensure that
   the filenamed-keyed cache employed by the TemplateLoader doesn't mix up
   templates with the same name, but from different subdirectories.


Version 0.3.2
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.2/
(Oct 12 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * Exceptions from templates now contain the absolute path to the template file
   when a search path is used. This enables tracebacks to display the line in
   question.
 * The template engine plugin now provides three different types: "genshi" and
   "genshi-markup" map to markup templates, while "genshi-text" maps to text
   templates.
 * Fixed the namespace context used by XPath patterns in py:match templates.
   The were erroneously using the namespace context of the elements being
   matched, where they should rather use the context in which they were
   defined.
 * The contents of `<script>` and `<style>` elements are no longer escaped when
   serializing to HTML but declaring the XHTML namespace in the template.
 * Improved error message raised when using the `py:for` directive on an object
   that is not iterable (ticket #60).
 * Fixed the XPath function `starts-with()` which was always returning true
   (ticket #61).


Version 0.3.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.1/
(Sep 22 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * Includes and user-defined filters were not getting the correct context data
   when used inside a match template (ticket #56).
 * XPath patterns using the union operator (`|`) were returning only partial
   results in some cases.


Version 0.3
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.3.0/
(Sep 17 2006, from branches/stable/0.3.x)

 * The project name was changed from "Markup" to "Genshi". See UPGRADE.txt
   for upgrade instructions.
 * Expression evaluation now differentiates between undefined variables and
   variables that are defined but set to `None`. This also means that local
   variables can override built-ins even if the local variable are set to
   `None` (ticket #36).
 * The plugin implementation now makes more functions available for use inside
   templates: XML(), HTML(), defined(), and value-of(). These are mostly for
   migration from Kid.
 * The parsing of `py:with` directives has been improved: you can now assign
   to multiple names, and semicolons inside string literals are treated as
   expected.
 * Generator expressions can now be used in template expressions (ticket #16).
 * Added serialization to plain text (ticket #41).
 * Calling functions from template expressions with *args and/or **kwargs
   now works correctly (ticket #42).
 * The `TemplateLoader` class and the `Template` instances that it manages are
   now thread-safe, as they no longer keep any state related to the current
   processing context.
 * Stream filters and serializers can now be applied using the "pipe" (bitwise
   or) operator "|".
 * The execution of named template functions (`py:def`) no longer silently
   swallows TypeError exceptions (ticket #44).
 * The XML Parser now correctly handles unicode input (ticket #43).
 * HTML entities can now be used in templates without having to declare an HTML
   document type.
 * Error reporting on undefined entities has been fixed.
 * Fix traversal of substreams by XPath expressions. For example, the path
   '*/*' no longer matches non-immediate child elements, and '@*' no longer
   matches the attributes of descendants.
 * Fixes for `py:match` which would get confused when it should be applied
   to multiple elements (ticket #49).
 * Using namespace prefixes in XPath expressions is now supported.
 * Expressions now correctly handle slices (ticket #51).
 * A simple text-based template language is now included for generating
   plain text output (ticket #47).


Version 0.2
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.2.0/
(Aug 22 2006, from branches/stable/0.2.x)

 * XPath syntax errors now contain position info (ticket #20).
 * Errors in expression evaluation now contain the correct line number in the
   template (ticket #22).
 * <script> and <style> element contents are no longer escaped when using HTML
   serialization (ticket #24).
 * In some cases expressions in templates did not get interpolated (ticket
   #26).
 * CDATA sections are now passed through the pipeline and serialized correctly.
   That allows using <script> or <style> elements in XHTML output that is still
   compatible with HTML user agents.
 * The XHTML serializer now correctly handles elements in foreign namespaces
   (such as SVG or MathML).
 * Fixed relative includes in templates on Windows (ticket #27).
 * Output can be encoded using legacy codecs such as ISO-8859-1. Any character
   not representable in the chosen encoding gets replaced by the corresponding
   XML character reference.
 * String literals in XPath expressions that contain spaces are now parsed
   as expected.
 * Added support for the XPath functions boolean(), ceiling(), concat(),
   contains(), false(), floor(), normalize-space(), number(), round(),
   starts-with(), string-length(), substring(), substring-after(),
   substring-before(), translate(), and true().
 * Non-ASCII characters in expressions should now be handled correctly (ticket
   #29).
 * Default values for arguments of template functions now also work with
   constants and complex expressions (they only worked for string or number
   literals before).
 * XPath expressions in now support XPath variables ($var) in predicates
   (ticket #31).
 * Expressions in templates can now span multiple lines if they are enclosed
   in curly braces.
 * py:def macros can now be invoked from within expressions inside attribute
   values (ticket #34).


Version 0.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/genshi/tags/0.1.0/
(Aug 3 2006, from branches/stable/0.1.x)

 * First public release
