  now installed along with the code, the code knows where to find
  them, and the default is to use them (actually, to embed them).
  Some adjustments to configuration files may be necessary.  The
  easiest way to obtain the new default behavior is to remove all
  settings whose name includes "stylesheet".

    file system, and will correct the URL in the user's browser.
  - Added ``BUGS.txt``, ``docs/dev/policies.txt``,
    ``docs/dev/website.txt``, ``docs/dev/release.txt`` from all but
    the "To Do" list itself in ``docs/dev/todo.txt``.

  Docutils client code, to be used as-is or as models for variations.

* docutils/frontend.py:

  - Added "--traceback" & "--no-traceback" options ("traceback"
    setting).
  - Implemented support for config file reorganization:
    ``standard_config_files`` moved from ``ConfigParser`` to
    ``OptionParser``; added
    ``OptionParser.get_config_file_settings()`` and
    ``.get_standard_config_settings()``; support for old "[options]"

    (option lists).
  - Fixed handling of backslashes in substitution definitions.
  - Fixed off-by-1 error with extra whitespace after substitution
    definition directive.
  - Added inline markup parsing to field lists' field names.
  - Added support for quoted (and unindented) literal blocks.
    Driven in part by a bribe from Frank Siebenlist (thanks!).

  - Made embedded-URIs' reference text omittable.  Idea from Beni
    Cherniavsky.
  - Refactored explicit target processing code.
  - Added name attribute to references containing the reference name only
    through whitespace_normalize_name (no case changes).
  - parse_target no longer returns the refname after going through
    normalize_name. This is now handled in make_target.
  - Fixed bug relating to role-less interpreted text in non-English
    contexts.
  - Reorganized interpreted text processing; moved code into the new
    roles.py module.  Contributed by Edward Loper.

  - Added name attribute to references containing the reference name only
    through whitespace_normalize_name (no case changes).

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/misc.py:

  - Isolated the import of the ``urllib2`` module; was causing
    problems on SourceForge (``libssl.so.2`` unavailable?).
  - Added the "role" directive for declaring custom interpreted text
    roles.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/parts.py:

  - The "contents" directive does more work up-front, creating the
    "topic" and "title", and leaving the "pending" node for the
    transform.  Allows earlier reference resolution; fixes subtle bug.

* docutils/parsers/rst/languages/af.py: Added to project; Afrikaans
  mappings by Jannie Hofmeyr.

* docutils/parsers/rst/languages/cs.py: Added to project; Czech
  mappings by Marek Blaha.

    transform.  Allows earlier reference resolution; fixes subtle bug.
  - Added support for disabling of section numbering.

* docutils/transforms/references.py:

  - Verifying that external targets are truly targets and not indirect
    references. This is because we are now adding a "name" attribute to
    references in addition to targets. Note sure if this is correct!
  - Added code to hook into the unknown_reference_resolvers list for a
    transformer in resolve_indirect_target. This allows the
    unknown_reference_resolvers to keep around indirect targets which
    docutils doesn't know about.
  - Added specific error message for duplicate targets.

* docutils/transforms/universal.py:

  - Added FilterMessages transform (removes system messages below the
    verbosity threshold).
  - Added hook (via docutils.TransformSpec.unknown_reference_resolvers)
    to FinalCheckVisitor for application-specific handling of
    unresolvable references.
  - Added specific error message for duplicate targets.

* docutils/writers/__init__.py:

  - Added assemble_parts method to the Writer class to allow for
    access to a documents individual parts.
  - Documented & set default for ``Writer.output`` attribute.

* docutils/writers/html4css1.py:

  - Fixed unicode handling of attribute values (bug 760673).
  - Prevent duplication of "class" attribute values (bug report from
    Kirill Lapshin).
  - Improved table grid/border handling (prompted by report from Bob
    Marshall).
  - Added support for table titles.
  - Added "<title />" for untitled docs, for XHTML conformance; thanks
    to Darek Suchojad.
  - Added functionality to keep track of individual parts of a document
    and store them in a dictionary as the "parts" attribute of the writer.
    Contributed by Reggie Dugard at the Docutils sprint at PyCon DC 2004.
  - Added proper support for the "scale" attribute of the "image"
    element.  Contributed by Brent Cook.
  - Added ``--initial-header-level`` option.
  - Fixed bug: the body_pre_docinfo segment depended on there being a
    docinfo; if no docinfo, the document title was incorporated into
    the body segment.  Adversely affected the publish_parts interface.

* docutils/writers/latex2e.py:

  - Changed default stylesheet to "no stylesheet" to avoid latex complaining
    about a missing file.
  - Added options and support: ``--compound-enumerators``,
    ``--section-prefix-for-enumerators``, and
    ``--section-enumerator-separator``.  By John F Meinel Jr (SF patch
    934322).
  - Added option ``--use-verbatim-when-possible``, to avoid
    problematic characters (eg, '~' in italian) in literal blocks.
  - It's now possible to use four section levels in the `book` and
    `report` LaTeX classes.  The default `article` class still has
    three levels limit.

    files.
  - Added test/test_writers/test_htmlfragment.py.

* test/DocutilsTestSupport.py:

  - Refactored LaTeX publisher test suite/case class names to make
    testing other writers easier.
  - Added HtmlWriterPublishTestCase and HtmlFragmentTestSuite classes
    to test the processing of HTML fragments which use the new
    publish_parts convenience function.

* tools/buildhtml.py:

  - Added support for the "--prune" option.
  - Removed dependency on pep2html.py; plaintext PEPs no longer
    supported.

* tools/docutils.conf:

  - Updated for configuration file reorganization.

* tools/rst2html.py:

Release 0.2 (2002-07-31)
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".
- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.
- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or
  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
- Added support for an option values object which carries default
  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).
- Added internal Unicode support, and support for both input and
  output encodings.
- Added support for the ``docutils.io.IO`` class & subclasses.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Added ``ApplicationError`` and ``DataError``, for use throughout
    the package.

    command-line support.
  - Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``
    methods.
  - Reworked I/O model for ``docutils.io`` wrappers.
  - Updated ``Publisher.set_options()``; now returns option values
    object.
  - Added support for configuration files (/etc/docutils.conf,
    ./docutils.conf, ~/.docutils).
  - Added ``Publisher.setup_option_parser()``.
  - Added default usage message and description.

* docutils/frontend.py: Added to project; support for front-end
  (command-line) scripts.  Option specifications may be augmented by

  package, with added option groups and other modifications.  The use
  of this module is probably only temporary.
