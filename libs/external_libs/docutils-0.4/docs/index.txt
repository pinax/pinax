Docutils Stakeholders
=====================

Docutils stakeholders can be categorized in several groups:

1. End-users: users of reStructuredText and the Docutils tools.
   Although some are developers (e.g. Python developers utilizing
   reStructuredText for docstrings in their source), many are not.

2. Client-developers: developers using Docutils as a library,
   programmers developing *with* Docutils.

3. Component-developers: those who implement application-specific
   components, directives, and/or roles, separately from Docutils.

4. Core-developers: developers of the Docutils codebase and
   participants in the Docutils project community.

5. Re-implementers: developers of alternate implementations of
   Docutils.

There's a lot of overlap between these groups.  Most (perhaps all)
core-developers, component-developers, client-developers, and
re-implementers are also end-users.  Core-developers are also
client-developers, and may also be component-developers in other
projects.  Component-developers are also client-developers.


Project Fundamentals
====================

These files are for all Docutils stakeholders.  They are kept at the
top level of the Docutils project directory.

:README.txt_: Project overview: quick-start, requirements,
              installation, and usage.
:COPYING.txt_: Conditions for Docutils redistribution, with links to
               licenses.
:FAQ.txt_: Docutils Frequently Asked Questions.  If you have a
           question or issue, there's a good chance it's already
           answered here.
:BUGS.txt_: A list of known bugs, and how to report a bug.
:RELEASE-NOTES.txt_: Summary of the major changes in recent releases.
:HISTORY.txt_: Detailed change history log.
:THANKS.txt_: Acknowledgements.

.. _ref:

``ref/``: Reference Material for All Groups
===========================================

Many of these files began as developer specifications, but now that
they're mature and used by end-users and client-developers, they have
become reference material.  Successful specs evolve into refs.

Docutils-general:

* `The Docutils Document Tree <ref/doctree.html>`__ (incomplete)
* `Docutils Transforms <ref/transforms.html>`__
* `Docutils Generic DTD <ref/docutils.dtd>`__
* `OASIS XML Exchange Table Model Declaration Module
  <ref/soextblx.dtd>`__ (CALS tables DTD module)

Although not in the "ref" directory, `PEP 258`_ is a must-read
reference for any Docutils developer.

reStructuredText_:

* `An Introduction to reStructuredText <ref/rst/introduction.html>`__
  (includes the `Goals <ref/rst/introduction.html#goals>`__ and
  `History <ref/rst/introduction.html#history>`__ of reStructuredText)

* `PEP 256: Docstring Processing System Framework`__ is a high-level
  generic proposal.  [`PEP 256`__ in the `master repository`_]
* `PEP 257: Docstring Conventions`__ addresses docstring style and
  touches on content.  [`PEP 257`__ in the `master repository`_]
* `PEP 258: Docutils Design Specification`__ is an overview of the
  architecture of Docutils.  It documents design issues and
  implementation details.  [`PEP 258`__ in the `master repository`_]
* `PEP 287: reStructuredText Docstring Format`__ proposes a standard
  markup syntax.  [`PEP 287`__ in the `master repository`_]

Please note that PEPs in the `master repository`_ may not be current,
whereas the local versions are.
