# VIEW

# which view (template engine) to use if one is not specified in the
# template name

# The following kid settings determine the settings used by the kid serializer.

# One of (html|xml|json)

# VISIT TRACKING
# Each visit to your application will be assigned a unique visit ID tracked via
# a cookie sent to the visitor's browser.
# --------------

# Enable Visit tracking

# Number of minutes a visit may be idle before it expires.
# visit.timeout=20

# The name of the cookie to transmit to the visitor's browser.
# visit.cookie.name="tg-visit"

# Domain name to specify when setting the cookie (must begin with . according to
# RFC 2109). The default (None) should work for most cases and will default to
# the machine to which the request was made. NOTE: localhost is NEVER a valid
# value and will NOT WORK.
# visit.cookie.domain=None

# Specific path for the cookie
# visit.cookie.path="/"

# The name of the VisitManager plugin to use for visitor tracking.
visit.manager="sqlobject"

# Database class to use for visit tracking

# IDENTITY
# General configuration of the TurboGears Identity management module
# --------

# Switch to turn on or off the Identity management module
identity.on=True

# [REQUIRED] URL to which CherryPy will internally redirect when an access
# control check fails. If Identity management is turned on, a value for this
# option must be specified.
identity.failure_url="/login"

# identity.provider='sqlobject'

# The names of the fields on the login form containing the visitor's user ID
# and password. In addition, the submit button is specified simply so its
# existence may be stripped out prior to passing the form data to the target
# controller.
# identity.form.user_name="user_name"
# identity.form.password="password"
# identity.form.submit="login"

# What sources should the identity provider consider when determining the
# identity associated with a request? Comma separated list of identity sources.
# Valid sources: form, visit, http_auth
# identity.source="form,http_auth,visit"

# SqlObjectIdentityProvider
# Configuration options for the default IdentityProvider
# -------------------------

# The classes you wish to use for your Identity model. Remember to not use reserved
# SQL keywords for class names (at least unless you specify a different table
# name using sqlmeta).

# The password encryption algorithm used when comparing passwords against what's
# stored in the database. Valid values are 'md5' or 'sha1'. If you do not
# specify an encryption algorithm, passwords are expected to be clear text.
#
# The SqlObjectProvider *will* encrypt passwords supplied as part of your login
# form.  If you set the password through the password property, like:
# my_user.password = 'secret'
# the password will be encrypted in the database, provided identity is up and 
# running, or you have loaded the configuration specifying what encryption to
# use (in situations where identity may not yet be running, like tests).

# identity.soprovider.encryption_algorithm=None
