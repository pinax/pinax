A paragraph.

Inline Markup
`````````````

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``, standalone hyperlinks
(http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks (Python_), internal
cross-references (example_), external hyperlinks with embedded URIs
(`Python web site <http://www.python.org>`__), `anonymous hyperlink
references`__ (`a second reference`__), footnote references (manually
numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled auto-numbered
[#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references ([CIT2002]_),
substitution references (|example|), and _`inline hyperlink targets`
(see Targets_ below for a reference back to here).  Character-level
inline markup is also possible (although exceedingly ugly!) in *re*\
``Structured``\ *Text*.  Problems are indicated by |problematic| text
(generated by processing errors; this one is intentional).  Here is a
reference to the doctitle_ and the subtitle_.

__ http://www.python.org/
__ http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

The default role for interpreted text is `Title Reference`.  Here are
some explicit interpreted text roles: a PEP reference (:PEP:`287`); an
RFC reference (:RFC:`2822`); a :sub:`subscript`; a :sup:`superscript`;
and explicit roles for :emphasis:`standard` :strong:`inline`
:literal:`markup`.

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a
live link to PEP 258 here.

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records.  They are often part of an extension syntax.  They are
       an unambiguous variant of RFC 2822 fields.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

:credits:

    .. class:: credits

    This paragraph has the `credits` class set.  (This is actually not
    about credits but just for ensuring that the class attribute
    doesn't get stripped away.)

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

This section tests line blocks.  Line blocks are body elements which
consist of lines and other line blocks.  Nested line blocks cause
indentation.

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     New lines begin with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indent are significant, and preserved.
|         Continuation lines are also possible.  A long line that is intended
          to wrap should begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Another line block, surrounded by paragraphs:

| And it's no good waiting by the window
| It's no good waiting for the sun
| Please believe me, the things you dream of
| They don't fall in the lap of no-one

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four
    |
    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks
--------------

>>> print 'Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"'
Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'
(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

   This is the second paragraph.

   And this is the third paragraph.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.

Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_, and a [nonexistent]_
citation.

.. _Another Target:

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_, which generates an
error.

Duplicate Target Names
``````````````````````

Duplicate names in section headers or other implicit targets will
generate "info" (level-1) system messages.  Duplicate names in
explicit targets will generate "warning" (level-2) system messages.

Duplicate Target Names
``````````````````````

Since there are two "Duplicate Target Names" section headers, we
cannot uniquely refer to either of them by name.  If we try to (like
this: `Duplicate Target Names`_), an error is generated.

Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

These are just a sample of the many reStructuredText Directives.  For
others, please see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html.

Document Parts
``````````````

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(a local, untitled table of contents_) and at the beginning of the
document (a document-wide `table of contents`_).

Images
``````

An image directive (also clickable -- a hyperlink reference):

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title.png
   :class: class1 class2
   :target: directives_

Image with multiple IDs:

.. _image target 1:
.. _image target 2:
.. _image target 3:
.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/title.png

A centered image:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :align: center

A left-aligned image:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :align: left

A right-aligned image:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :align: right

A figure directive:

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :figclass: figclass1 figclass2
   :class: class1 class2
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax
   :align: right
   :width: 50

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Structured | Structure-enhanced text, structuredtext.      |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Text       | Well it is, isn't it?                         |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   This paragraph is also part of the legend.

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :figclass: figclass1 figclass2
   :class: class1 class2
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax
   :align: left
   :width: 50

   A left-aligned figure.

   This is the legend.

This paragraph might flow around the figure...

A centered figure:

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :align: center
   :width: 50

   This is the caption.

   This is the legend.

   The legend may consist of several paragraphs.

This paragraph might flow around the figure...

A left-aligned figure:

.. figure:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :align: left
   :width: 50

   This is the caption.

   This is the legend.

   The legend may consist of several paragraphs.

This paragraph might flow around the figure...

Now widths:

An image 2 em wide:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :width: 2 em

An image 2 em wide and 30 pixel high:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :width: 2em
   :height: 30 px

An image occupying 70% of the line width:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :width: 70%

An image 3 cm high:

.. image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png
   :height: 3 cm

Compound Paragraph
``````````````````

.. compound::
   :class: some-class

   Compound 1, paragraph 1.

   Compound 1, paragraph 2.

   * Compound 1, list item one.
   * Compound 1, list item two.

Another compound statement:

   Compound 2, a literal block::

       Compound 2, literal.

   Compound 2, this is a test.

.. compound::

   Compound 3, only consisting of one paragraph.

.. compound::

   ::

       Compound 4.
       This one starts with a literal block.

   Compound 4, a paragraph.

Now something *really* perverted -- a nested compound block.  This is
just to test that it works at all; the results don't have to be
meaningful.

.. compound::

   Compound 5, block 1 (a paragraph).

   .. compound::

      Compound 6, block 2 in compound 5.

      Compound 6, another paragraph.

   Compound 5, block 3 (a paragraph).

.. compound::

   Compound 7, with a table inside:

   +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
   | Left cell, first   | Middle cell,       | Right cell.        |
   | paragraph.         | consisting of      |                    |
   |                    | exactly one        | Paragraph 2.       |
   | Left cell, second  | paragraph.         |                    |
   | paragraph.         |                    | Paragraph 3.       |

Parsed Literal Blocks
`````````````````````

.. parsed-literal::

   This is a parsed literal block.
       This line is indented.  The next line is blank.

   Inline markup is supported, e.g. *emphasis*, **strong**, ``literal
   text``, footnotes [1]_, _`targets`, and `references
   <http://www.python.org/>`_.

Substitution Definitions
------------------------

An inline image (|example|) example:

.. |EXAMPLE| image:: ../../../docs/user/rst/images/biohazard.png

(Substitution definitions are not visible in the HTML source.)

Comments
--------

Here's one:

.. Comments begin with two dots and a space. Anything may
   follow, except for the syntax of footnotes, hyperlink
   targets, directives, or substitution definitions.

   Double-dashes -- "--" -- must be escaped somehow in HTML output.

(View the HTML source to see the comment.)

Raw text
--------

This does not necessarily look nice, because there may be missing white space.

It's just there to freeze the behavior.

.. raw:: html latex

   A test.

.. raw:: html latex

   Second test.

.. class:: myclass

.. raw:: html latex

   Another test with myclass set.

.. role:: raw-role(raw)
   :format: html latex
   :class: myrawroleclass

This is the :raw-role:`fourth test` with myrawroleclass set.

.. raw:: html

   Fifth test in HTML.<br />Line two.

.. raw:: latex

   Fifth test in LaTeX.\\Line two.

Container
---------

.. container:: custom

   paragraph 1
