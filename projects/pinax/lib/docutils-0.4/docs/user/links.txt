.. title:: Docutils Links

.. contents::

This document contains links users of Docutils and reStructuredText
may find useful, listed in no particular order.  Many of the project
listed here are hosted in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.  If you have
something to publish, you can get write access, too!

The most current version of this link list can always be found at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html.

  dumps of the document tree (e.g. created with rst2xml.py) back to
  reStructuredText.

* xhtml2rest_, written by Antonios Christofides, is a simple utility
  to convert XHTML to reStructuredText.

  to handle everything one might do with Docutils.

This section contains links which are primarily interesting for
developers who use the Docutils API from within their own
applications.

* Nabu_, written by Martin Blais, is a publishing system which
  extracts information from reStructuredText documents and stores it

  functions (see `Writing an Extractor`_) and to retrieve the data
  from the database again.

* There is a `pickle writer`_, written by Martin Blais.


Core Developers
---------------

Links primarily interesting for developers who work with the Docutils
