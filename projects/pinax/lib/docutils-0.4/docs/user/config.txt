.. Cross-reference command-line options with configuration file
   settings?  Make alphabetical indexes of both.

Configuration files are used for persistent customization; they can be
set once and take effect every time you use a front-end tool.
Configuration file settings override the built-in defaults, and
command-line options override all.

By default, Docutils checks the following places for configuration
files, in the following order:

1. ``/etc/docutils.conf``: This is a system-wide configuration file,
   applicable to all Docutils processing on the system.

2. ``./docutils.conf``: This is a project-specific configuration file,
   located in the current directory.  The Docutils front end has to be
   executed from the directory containing this configuration file for
   it to take effect (note that this may have nothing to do with the
   location of the source files).  Settings in the project-specific
   configuration file will override corresponding settings in the
   system-wide file.

3. ``~/.docutils``: This is a user-specific configuration file,
   located in the user's home directory.  Settings in this file will
   override corresponding settings in both the system-wide and
   project-specific configuration files.

If more than one configuration file is found, all will be read but
later entries will override earlier ones.  For example, a "stylesheet"
entry in a user-specific configuration file will override a
"stylesheet" entry in the system-wide file.

The default implicit config file paths can be overridden by the
``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable.  ``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` should
contain a colon-separated (semicolon-separated on Windows) sequence of
config file paths to search for; leave it empty to disable implicit
config files altogether.  Tilde-expansion is performed on paths.
Paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory.
Empty path items are ignored.

In addition, a configuration file may be explicitly specified with the
"--config" command-line option.  This configuration file is read after
the three implicit ones listed above (or the ones defined by the
``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable), and its entries will have
priority.


-------------------------
Configuration File Syntax
-------------------------

Configuration files use the standard ConfigParser.py_ Python_ module.
From its documentation:

    The configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]"
    header and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations
    in the style of `RFC 822`_; "name=value" is also accepted.  Note
    that leading whitespace is removed from values.  ...  Lines
    beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
    comments.

.. Note:: No format string interpolation is done.

Configuration file entry names correspond to internal runtime
settings.  Underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-") can be used
interchangably in entry names; hyphens are automatically converted to
underscores.

For on/off switch settings (booleans), the following values are
recognized:

* On: "true", "yes", "on", "1"
* Off: "false", "no", "off", "0", "" (no value)


-------------------------------------
Configuration File Sections & Entries
-------------------------------------

Below are the Docutils runtime settings, listed by config file
section.  Any setting may be specified in any section, but only
settings from active sections will be used.  Sections correspond to
Docutils components (module name or alias; section names are always in
lowercase letters).  Each `Docutils application`_ uses a specific set
of components; corresponding configuration file sections are applied
when the application is used.  Configuration sections are applied in
general-to-specific order, as follows:

1. `[general]`_

2. `[parsers]`_, parser dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Parser used ("[... parser]").  Currently, only `[restructuredtext
   parser]`_ is applicable.

3. `[readers]`_, reader dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Reader used ("[... reader]").  For example, `[pep reader]`_ depends
   on `[standalone reader]`_.

4. `[writers]`_, writer dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Writer used ("[... writer]").  For example, `[pep_html writer]`_
   depends on `[html4css1 writer]`_.

5. `[applications]`_, application dependencies, and the section
    specific to the Application (front-end tool) in use
    ("[... application]").

Since any setting may be specified in any section, this ordering
allows component- or application-specific overrides of earlier
settings.  For example, there may be Reader-specific overrides of
general settings; Writer-specific overrides of Parser settings;
Application-specific overrides of Writer settings; and so on.

If multiple configuration files are applicable, the process is
completed (all sections are applied in the order given) for each one
before going on to the next.  For example, a "[pep_html writer]
stylesheet" setting in an earlier configuration file would be
overridden by an "[html4css1 writer] stylesheet" setting in a later
file.

Some knowledge of Python_ is assumed for some attributes.

[general]
=========

Settings in the "[general]" section are always applied.

_`auto_id_prefix`
    Prefix prepended to all auto-generated IDs generated within the
    document, after id_prefix_.

    Default: "id".  Options: ``--auto-id-prefix`` (hidden, intended
    mainly for programmatic use).
    
_`datestamp`
    Include a time/datestamp in the document footer.  Contains a
    format string for Python's ``time.strftime``.  See the `time
    module documentation`__.

    Default: None.  Options: ``--date, -d, --time, -t,
    --no-datestamp``.

    Configuration file entry examples::

        # Equivalent to --date command-line option, results in
        # ISO 8601 extended format datestamp, e.g. "2001-12-21":
        datestamp: %Y-%m-%d

        # Equivalent to --time command-line option, results in
        # date/timestamp like "2001-12-21 18:43 UTC":
        datestamp: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC

        # Disables datestamp; equivalent to --no-datestamp:
        datestamp:

    ``--leave-comments``.

_`title`
    The document title as metadata, which does not become part of the
    document body.  It overrides a document-supplied title.  For
    example, in HTML output the metadata document title appears in the
    title bar of the browser window.

    Default: none.  Option: ``--title``.

_`docinfo_xform`
    Enable or disable the bibliographic field list transform
    (docutils.transforms.frontmatter.DocInfo).

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--no-doc-info``.

Under construction.


[writers]
---------

[docutils_xml writer]
`````````````````````

_`doctype_declaration`
    Generate XML with a DOCTYPE declaration.

    Default: do (1).  Options: ``--no-doctype``.

_`indents`
    Generate XML with indents and newlines.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--indents``.

_`newlines`
    Generate XML with newlines before and after tags.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--newlines``.

.. _xml_declaration [docutils_xml writer]:

xml_declaration
    Generate XML with an XML declaration.  Also defined for the
    `HTML Writer`__.

    .. Caution:: The XML declaration carries text encoding
       information, without which standard tools may be unable to read
       the generated XML.

    Default: do (1).  Options: ``--no-xml-declaration``.

    __ `xml_declaration [html4css1 writer]`_


[html4css1 writer]
``````````````````

.. _attribution [html4css1 writer]:

attribution
    Format for block quote attributions: one of "dash" (em-dash
    prefix), "parentheses"/"parens", or "none".  Also defined for the
    `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Default: "dash".  Options: ``--attribution``.

    __ `attribution [latex2e writer]`_

_`cloak_email_addresses`
    Scramble email addresses to confuse harvesters.  In the reference
    URI, the "@" will be replaced by %-escapes (as of RFC 1738).  In
    the visible text (link text) of an email reference, the "@" and
    all periods (".") will be surrounded by ``<span>`` tags.
    Furthermore, HTML entities are used to encode these characters in
    order to further complicate decoding the email address.  For
    example, "abc@example.org" will be output as::

        <a class="reference" href="mailto:abc&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;org">
        abc<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>org</a>

    .. Note:: While cloaking email addresses will have little to no
       impact on the rendering and usability of email links in most
       browsers, some browsers (e.g. the ``links`` browser) may decode
       cloaked email addresses incorrectly.

    Default: don't cloak (None).  Option: ``--cloak-email-addresses``.

_`compact_lists`
    Remove extra vertical whitespace between items of bullet lists and
    enumerated lists, when list items are all "simple" (i.e., items
    each contain one paragraph and/or one "simple" sublist only).  The
    behaviour can be specified directly via "class" attributes (values
    "compact" and "open") in the document.

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--compact-lists,
    --no-compact-lists``.

_`compact_field_lists`
    Remove extra vertical whitespace between items of field lists that
    are "simple" (i.e., all field bodies each contain at most one
    paragraph).  The behaviour can be specified directly via "class"
    attributes (values "compact" and "open") in the document.

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--compact-field-lists,
    --no-compact-field-lists``.

_`embed_stylesheet`

    --link-stylesheet``.

_`field_name_limit`
    The maximum width (in characters) for one-column field names.
    Longer field names will span an entire row of the table used to
    render the field list.  0 indicates "no limit".  See also
    option_limit_.

    Default: 14 characters.  Option: ``--field-name-limit``.

.. _footnote_references [html4css1 writer]:

footnote_references
    Format for footnote references, one of "superscript" or
    "brackets".  Also defined for the `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Overrides [#override]_ trim_footnote_reference_space_, if
    applicable. [#footnote_space]_

    Default: "brackets".  Option: ``--footnote-references``.

    __ `footnote_references [latex2e writer]`_

_`initial_header_level`
    The initial level for header elements.  This does not affect the
    document title & subtitle; see doctitle_xform_.

    Default: 1 (for "<h1>").  Option: ``--initial-header-level``.

_`option_limit`
    The maximum width (in characters) for options in option lists.
    Longer options will span an entire row of the table used to render
    the option list.  0 indicates "no limit".  See also
    field_name_limit_.

    Default: 14 characters.  Option: ``--option-limit``.

.. _stylesheet [html4css1 writer]:

stylesheet
    CSS stylesheet URL, used verbatim.  Overrides the
    "stylesheet_path" setting [#override]_.  Pass an empty string to
    deactivate stylesheet inclusion.

    Default: None.  Options: ``--stylesheet``.

stylesheet_path
    Path to CSS stylesheet [#pwd]_.  Overrides the "stylesheet" URL
    setting [#override]_.  Path is adjusted relative to the output
    HTML file.  Also defined for the `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Default: "html4css1.css" in the docutils/writers/html4css1/
    directory (installed automatically; for the exact machine-specific
    path, use the ``--help`` option).  Options: ``--stylesheet-path``.

    __ `stylesheet_path [latex2e writer]`_

.. _xml_declaration [html4css1 writer]:

xml_declaration
    Generate XML with an XML declaration.  Also defined for the
    `Docutils XML Writer`__.

       the generated XML.

    Default: do (1).  Options: ``--no-xml-declaration``.

    __ `xml_declaration [docutils_xml writer]`_


[pep_html writer]
.................

The PEP/HTML Writer derives from the standard HTML Writer, and shares
all settings defined in the `[html4css1 writer]`_ section.  The
"[html4css1 writer]" section of configuration files is processed
before the "[pep_html writer]" section.

The PEP/HTML Writer's default for the ``stylesheet_path`` setting
differs from that of the standard HTML Writer:
``docutils/writers/pep_html/pep.css`` in the installation directory is
used.  For the exact machine-specific path, use the ``--help`` option.

_`no_random`
    Do not use a random banner image.  Mainly used to get predictable
    results when testing.

    Default: random enabled (None).  Options: ``--no-random``
    (hidden).

    Python's home URL.

    Default: parent directory ("..").  Options: ``--python-home``.


[s5_html writer]
.................

The S5/HTML Writer derives from the standard HTML Writer, and shares
all settings defined in the `[html4css1 writer]`_ section.  The
"[html4css1 writer]" section of configuration files is processed
before the "[s5_html writer]" section.

The S5/HTML Writer's default for the ``compact_lists`` setting differs
from that of the standard HTML Writer: the default here is to disable
compact lists.

_`current_slide`

    Enable or disable the current slide indicator ("1/15").

    Default: disabled (None).  Options: ``--current-slide``,
    ``--no-current-slide``.

_`overwrite_theme_files`
    Allow or prevent the overwriting of existing theme files in the
    ``ui/<theme>`` directory.  This has no effect if "theme_url_" is
    used.

    Default: keep existing theme files (None).  Options:
    ``--keep-theme-files``, ``--overwrite-theme-files``.

_`theme`
    Name of an installed S5 theme, to be copied into a ``ui/<theme>``
    subdirectory, beside the destination file (output HTML).  Note
    that existing theme files will not be overwritten; the existing
    theme directory you must be deleted manually.  Overrides the
    "theme_url_" setting [#override]_.

    Default: "default".  Option: ``--theme``.

_`theme_url`
    The URL of an S5 theme directory.  The destination file (output
    HTML) will link to this theme; nothing will be copied.  Overrides
    the "theme_" setting [#override]_.

[latex2e writer]
````````````````

_`use_latex_toc`
    To get pagenumbers in the table of contents the table of contents
    must be generated by latex. Usually latex must be run twice to get
    numbers correct.

    *Note:* LaTeX will number the sections, which might be a bug in
    this case.

    Default: off.  Option: ``--use-latex-toc``.

.. XXX Missing: use_latex_docinfo

_`use_latex_footnotes`
    Use LaTeX-footnotes not a figure simulation. This might give no
    Hyperrefs on /to footnotes, but should be able to handle an
    unlimited number of footnotes.

    Default: off.  Option: ``--use-latex-footnotes``.

_`hyperlink_color`
    Color of any hyperlinks embedded in text. Use "0" to disable
    coloring of links.

    Default: "blue".  Option: ``--hyperlink-color``.

_`documentclass`
    Specify latex documentclass, *but* beaware that books have chapters
    articles not.

    Default: "article".  Option: ``--documentclass``.

_`documentoptions`
    Specify document options.  Multiple options can be given, separated by
    commas.

    Default: "10pt,a4paper".  Option: ``--documentoptions``.

.. _stylesheet [latex2e writer]:

stylesheet
    Specify a stylesheet file.  Overrides stylesheet_path
    [#override]_.  The file will be ``\input`` by latex in the
    document header.  Also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Default: no stylesheet ("").  Option: ``--stylesheet``.

    __ `stylesheet [html4css1 writer]`_

.. _stylesheet_path [latex2e writer]:

stylesheet_path
    Path to stylesheet [#pwd]_.  Overrides "stylesheet" setting
    (``--stylesheet``) [#override]_.

    Please note that you will have to run ``latex`` from the directory
    containing the output file; otherwise the stylesheet reference
    will be invalid.

    This setting is also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Default: None.  Option: ``--stylesheet-path``.

    __ `stylesheet_path [html4css1 writer]`_

.. XXX Missing: embed_stylesheet

.. _footnote_references [latex2e writer]:

footnote_references
    Format for footnote references: one of "superscript" or
    "brackets".  Also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Overrides [#override]_ trim_footnote_reference_space_, if
    applicable. [#footnote_space]_

    Default: "superscript".  Option: ``--footnote-references``.

    __ `footnote_references [html4css1 writer]`_

.. _attribution [latex2e writer]:

attribution
    Format for block quote attributions, the same as for the
    html-writer: one of "dash" (em-dash prefix),
    "parentheses"/"parens" or "none".  Also defined for the `HTML
    Writer`__.

    Default: "dash".  Option: ``--attribution``.

    __ `attribution [html4css1 writer]`_

_`compound_enumerators`
    Enable or disable compound enumerators for nested enumerated lists
    (e.g. "1.2.a.ii").

    Default: disabled (None).  Options: ``--compound-enumerators``,
    ``--no-compound-enumerators``.

_`section_prefix_for_enumerators`
    Enable or disable section ("." subsection ...) prefixes for
    compound enumerators.  This has no effect unless
    `compound_enumerators`_ are enabled.
    
    Default: disabled (None).  Options:
    ``--section-prefix-for-enumerators``,
    ``--no-section-prefix-for-enumerators``.

_`section_enumerator_separator`
    The separator between section number prefix and enumerator for
    compound enumerated lists (see `compound_enumerators`_).

    Generally it isn't recommended to use both sub-sections and nested
    enumerated lists with compound enumerators.  This setting avoids
    ambiguity in the situation where a section "1" has a list item
    enumerated "1.1", and subsection "1.1" has list item "1".  With a
    separator of ".", these both would translate into a final compound
    enumerator of "1.1.1".  With a separator of "-", we get the
    unambiguous "1-1.1" and "1.1-1".

    Default: "-".  Option: ``--section-enumerator-separator``.

_`table_style`
    Specify the drawing of separation lines.

    - "standard" lines around and between cells.
    - "booktabs" a line above and below the table and one after the
      head.
    - "nolines".

    Default: "standard".  Option: ``--table-style``.

_`prune`
    List of directories not to process.  To specify multiple
    directories in configuration files, use colon-separated paths; on
    the command line, the option may be used more than once.

    Default: none ([]).  Options: ``--prune``.

_`recurse`
    Recursively scan subdirectories, or ignore subdirectories.

    Default: recurse (1).  Options: ``--recurse, --local``.

_`silent`
    Work silently (no progress messages).  Independent of
    "report_level".

    Default: show progress (None).  Options: ``--silent``.

Other Settings
==============

These settings are only effective as command-line options, positional
arguments, or for internal use; setting them in configuration files
has no effect.

_`config`
    Path to a configuration file to read (if it exists) [#pwd]_.
    Settings may override defaults and earlier settings.  The config
    file is processed immediately.  Multiple ``--config`` options may
    be specified; each will be processed in turn.

    Filesystem path settings contained within the config file will be
    interpreted relative to the config file's location (*not* relative
    to the current working directory).

    Default: None.  Options: ``--config``.

_`_directories`
    (``buildhtml.py`` front end.)  List of paths to source
    directories, set from positional arguments.

    Default: current working directory (None).  No command-line
    options.

_`_disable_config`
    Prevent standard configuration files from being read.  For
    programmatic use only.

    Default: config files enabled (None).  No command-line options.

_`_destination`
    Path to output destination, set from positional arguments.

    Default: stdout (None).  No command-line options.

_`_source`
    Path to input source, set from positional arguments.

    Default: stdin (None).  No command-line options.

.. _ISO 639: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html

.. [#pwd] Path relative to the working directory of the process at
   launch.

.. [#override] The overridden setting will automatically be set to
   ``None`` for command-line options and config file settings.  Client
   programs which specify defaults that override other settings must
   do the overriding explicitly, by assigning ``None`` to the other
   settings.

.. [#dependencies] Some notes on the dependency recorder:

   * Images are only added to the dependency list if the
     reStructuredText parser extracted image dimensions from the file.

   * Stylesheets are only added if they are embedded.

   * For practical reasons, the output of the LaTeX writer is
     considered merely an *intermediate* processing stage.  The
     dependency recorder records all files the *rendered* file
     (e.g. in PDF or DVI format) depends on.  Thus, images and
     stylesheets are both unconditionally recorded as dependencies
     when using the LaTeX writer.
   
.. [#footnote_space] The footnote space is trimmed if the reference
   style is "superscript", and it is left if the reference style is
   "brackets".

   The overriding only happens if the parser supports the
   trim_footnote_reference_space option.

Old-Format Configuration Files
------------------------------

Formerly, Docutils configuration files contained a single "[options]"
section only.  This was found to be inflexible, and in August 2003
Docutils adopted the current component-based configuration file
sections as described above.  Docutils will still recognize the old
"[options]" section, but complains with a deprecation warning.

To convert existing config files, the easiest way is to change the
section title: change "[options]" to "[general]".  Most settings
haven't changed.  The only ones to watch out for are these:
