This document describes the XML data structure of Docutils_ documents:
the relationships and semantics of elements and attributes.  The
Docutils document structure is formally defined by the `Docutils
Generic DTD`_ XML document type definition, docutils.dtd_, which is
the definitive source for details of element structural relationships.

This document does not discuss implementation details.  Those can be
found in internal documentation (docstrings) for the
``docutils.nodes`` module, where the document tree data structure is
implemented in a class library.

The reader is assumed to have some familiarity with XML or SGML, and
an understanding of the data structure meaning of "tree".  For a list
of introductory articles, see `Introducing the Extensible Markup
Language (XML)`_.

The reStructuredText_ markup is used for illustrative examples
throughout this document.  For a gentle introduction, see `A
ReStructuredText Primer`_.  For complete technical details, see the
`reStructuredText Markup Specification`_.

 Element Hierarchy
-------------------

.. contents:: :local:

Below is a simplified diagram of the hierarchy of elements in the
Docutils document tree structure.  An element may contain any other
elements immediately below it in the diagram.  Notes are written in
square brackets.  Element types in parentheses indicate recursive or
one-to-many relationships; sections may contain (sub)sections, tables
contain further body elements, etc. ::

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | document  [may begin with a title, subtitle, decoration, docinfo]  |
  |                             +--------------------------------------+
  |                             | sections  [each begins with a title] |
  +-----------------------------+-------------------------+------------+
  | [body elements:]                                      | (sections) |
  |         | - literal | - lists  |       | - hyperlink  +------------+
  |         |   blocks  | - tables |       |   targets    |
  | para-   | - doctest | - block  | foot- | - sub. defs  |
  | graphs  |   blocks  |   quotes | notes | - comments   |
  +---------+-----------+----------+-------+--------------+
  | [text]+ | [text]    | (body elements)  | [text]       |
  | (inline +-----------+------------------+--------------+
  | markup) |
  +---------+

The Docutils document model uses a simple, recursive model for section
structure.  A document_ node may contain body elements and section_
elements.  Sections in turn may contain body elements and sections.
The level (depth) of a section element is determined from its physical
nesting level; unlike other document models (``<h1>`` in HTML_,
``<sect1>`` in DocBook_, ``<div1>`` in XMLSpec_) the level is not
incorporated into the element name.

The Docutils document model uses strict element content models.  Every
element has a unique structure and semantics, but elements may be
classified into general categories (below).  Only elements which are
meant to directly contain text data have a mixed content model, where
text data and inline elements may be intermixed.  This is unlike the
much looser HTML_ document model, where paragraphs and text data may
occur at the same level.


Structural Elements
===================

Structural elements may only contain child elements; they do not
directly contain text data.  Structural elements may contain body
elements or further structural elements.  Structural elements can only
be child elements of other structural elements.

Category members: document_, section_, topic_, sidebar_


Structural Subelements
----------------------

Structural subelements are child elements of structural elements.
Simple structuctural subelements (title_, subtitle_) contain text
data; the others are compound and do not directly contain text data.

Category members: title_, subtitle_, decoration_, docinfo_,
transition_


Bibliographic Elements
``````````````````````

The docinfo_ element is an optional child of document_.  It groups
bibliographic elements together.  All bibliographic elements except
authors_ and field_ contain text data.  authors_ contains further
bibliographic elements (most notably author_).  field_ contains
field_name_ and field_body_ body subelements.

Category members: address_, author_, authors_, contact_, copyright_,
date_, field_, organization_, revision_, status_, version_


Decorative Elements
```````````````````

The decoration_ element is also an optional child of document_.  It
groups together elements used to generate page headers and footers.

Category members: footer_, header_


Body Elements
=============

Body elements are contained within structural elements and compound
body elements.  There are two subcategories of body elements: simple
and compound.

Category members: admonition_, attention_, block_quote_, bullet_list_,
caution_, citation_, comment_, compound_, container_, danger_,
definition_list_, doctest_block_, enumerated_list_, error_,
field_list_, figure_, footnote_, hint_, image_, important_,
line_block_, literal_block_, note_, option_list_, paragraph_,
pending_, raw_, rubric_, substitution_definition_, system_message_,
table_, target_, tip_, warning_


Simple Body Elements
--------------------

Simple body elements are empty or directly contain text data.  Those
that contain text data may also contain inline elements.  Such
elements therefore have a "mixed content model".

Category members: comment_, doctest_block_, image_, literal_block_,
paragraph_, pending_, raw_, rubric_, substitution_definition_, target_


Compound Body Elements
----------------------

Compound body elements contain local substructure (body subelements)
and further body elements.  They do not directly contain text data.

Category members: admonition_, attention_, block_quote_, bullet_list_,
caution_, citation_, compound_, container_, danger_, definition_list_,
enumerated_list_, error_, field_list_, figure_, footnote_, hint_,
important_, line_block, note_, option_list_, system_message_, table_,
tip_, warning_


Body Subelements
````````````````

Compound body elements contain specific subelements (e.g. bullet_list_
contains list_item_).  Subelements may themselves be compound elements
(containing further child elements, like field_) or simple data
elements (containing text data, like field_name_).  These subelements
always occur within specific parent elements, never at the body
element level (beside paragraphs, etc.).

Category members (simple): attribution_, caption_, classifier_,
colspec_, field_name_, label_, line_, option_argument_,
option_string_, term_

Category members (compound): definition_, definition_list_item_,
description_, entry_, field_, field_body_, legend_, list_item_,
option_, option_group_, option_list_item_, row_, tbody_, tgroup_,
thead_


Inline Elements
===============

Inline elements directly contain text data, and may also contain
further inline elements.  Inline elements are contained within simple
body elements.  Most inline elements have a "mixed content model".

Category members: abbreviation_, acronym_, citation_reference_,
emphasis_, footnote_reference_, generated_, image_, inline_, literal_,
problematic_, reference_, strong_, subscript_,
substitution_reference_, superscript_, target_, title_reference_, raw_

 Element Reference
-------------------

.. contents:: :local:
              :depth: 1

Each element in the DTD (document type definition) is described in its
own section below.  Each section contains an introduction plus the
following subsections:

* Details (of element relationships and semantics):

  - Category: One or more references to the element categories in
    `Element Hierarchy`_ above.  Some elements belong to more than one
    category.

  - Parents: A list of elements which may contain the element.

  - Children: A list of elements which may occur within the element.

  - Analogues: Describes analogous elements in well-known document
    models such as HTML_ or DocBook_.  Lists similarities and
    differences.

  - Processing: Lists formatting or rendering recommendations for the
    element.

* Content Model:

  The formal XML content model from the `Docutils DTD`_, followed by:

  - Attributes: Describes (or refers to descriptions of) the possible
    values and semantics of each attribute.

  - Parameter Entities: Lists the parameter entities which directly or
    indirectly include the element.

* Examples: reStructuredText_ examples are shown along with
  fragments of the document trees resulting from parsing.
  _`Pseudo-XML` is used for the results of parsing and processing.
  Pseudo-XML is a representation of XML where nesting is indicated by
  indentation and end-tags are not shown.  Some of the precision of
  real XML is given up in exchange for easier readability.  For
  example, the following are equivalent:

  - Real XML::

        <document>
        <section ids="a-title" names="a title">
        <title>A Title</title>
        <paragraph>A paragraph.</paragraph>
        </section>
        </document>

  - Pseudo-XML::

        <document>
            <section ids="a-title" names="a title">
                <title>
                    A Title
                <paragraph>
                    A paragraph.

--------------------

Many of the element reference sections below are marked "_`to be
completed`".  Please help complete this document by contributing to
its writing.


``abbreviation``
================

`To be completed`_.


``acronym``
===========

`To be completed`_.


``address``
===========

The ``address`` element holds the surface mailing address information
for the author (individual or group) of the document, or a third-party
contact address.  Its structure is identical to that of the
literal_block_ element: whitespace is significant, especially
newlines.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Bibliographic Elements`_

:Parents:
    The following elements may contain ``address``: docinfo_, authors_

:Children:
    ``address`` elements contain text data plus `inline elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``address`` is analogous to the DocBook "address" element.

:Processing:
    As with the literal_block_ element, newlines and other whitespace
    is significant and must be preserved.  However, a monospaced
    typeface need not be used.

    See also docinfo_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    `%text.model;`_

:Attributes:
    The ``address`` element contains the `common attributes`_ (ids_,
    names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_), plus `xml:space`_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%bibliographic.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``address``.


Examples
--------

        <paragraph>
            You can make up your own admonition too.


``attention``
=============

The ``attention`` element is an admonition, a distinctive and
self-contained notice.  Also see the other admonition elements
Docutils offers (in alphabetical order): caution_, danger_, error_,
hint_, important_, note_, tip_, warning_, and the generic admonition_.

                J. Random Hacker

See docinfo_ for a more complete example, including processing
context.


``authors``
===========

The ``authors`` element is a container for author information for
documents with multiple authors.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Bibliographic Elements`_

:Parents:
    Only the docinfo_ element contains ``authors``.

:Children:
    ``authors`` elements may contain the following elements: author_,
    organization_, address_, contact_

:Analogues:
    ``authors`` is analogous to the DocBook "authors" element.

:Processing:
    See docinfo_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    ((author_, organization_?, address_?, contact_?)+)

    ``authors``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

    Document Title
    ==============

    :Authors: J. Random Hacker; Jane Doe

Complete pseudo-XML_ result after parsing and applying transforms::

    <document ids="document-title" names="document title">
        <title>
            Document Title
        <docinfo>
            <authors>
                <author>

                <author>
                    Jane Doe

In reStructuredText, multiple author's names are separated with
semicolons (";") or commas (","); semicolons take precedence.  There
is currently no way to represent the author's organization, address,
or contact in a reStructuredText "Authors" field.

See docinfo_ for a more complete example, including processing
context.


``block_quote``
===============

The ``block_quote`` element is used for quotations set off from the
main text (standalone).


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``block_quote``.

:Children:
    ``block_quote`` elements contain `body elements`_ followed by an
    optional attribution_ element.

:Analogues:
    ``block_quote`` is analogous to the "blockquote" element in both
    HTML and DocBook.

:Processing:
    ``block_quote`` elements serve to set their contents off from the
    main text, typically with indentation and/or other decoration.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   ((`%body.elements;`_)+, attribution_?)

:Attributes:
    The ``block_quote`` element contains only the `common
    attributes`_: ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%body.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``block_quote``.  The `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity
    indirectly includes ``block_quote``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText source::

    As a great paleontologist once said,

        This theory, that is mine, is mine.

        -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Pseudo-XML_ fragment from simple parsing::

    <paragraph>
        As a great paleontologist once said,
    <block_quote>
        <paragraph>
            This theory, that is mine, is mine.
        <attribution>
            Anne Elk (Miss)


``bullet_list``
===============

The ``bullet_list`` element contains list_item_ elements which are
uniformly marked with bullets.  Bullets are typically simple dingbats
(symbols) such as circles and squares.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``bullet_list``.

:Children:
    ``bullet_list`` elements contain one or more list_item_ elements.

:Analogues:
    ``bullet_list`` is analogous to the HTML "ul" element and to the
    DocBook "itemizedlist" element.  HTML's "ul" is short for
    "unordered list", which we consider to be a misnomer.  "Unordered"
    implies that the list items may be randomly rearranged without
    affecting the meaning of the list.  Bullet lists *are* often
    ordered; the ordering is simply left implicit.

:Processing:
    Each list item should begin a new vertical block, prefaced by a
    bullet/dingbat.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    (list_item_ +)

:Attributes:
    The ``bullet_list`` element contains the `common attributes`_
    (ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_), plus bullet_.

    ``bullet`` is used to record the style of bullet from the input
    data.  In documents processed from reStructuredText_, it contains
    one of "-", "+", or "*".  It may be ignored in processing.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%body.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``bullet_list``.  The `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity
    indirectly includes ``bullet_list``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

    - Item 1, paragraph 1.

      Item 1, paragraph 2.

    - Item 2.

Pseudo-XML_ fragment from simple parsing::

    <bullet_list bullet="-">
        <list_item>
            <paragraph>
                Item 1, paragraph 1.
            <paragraph>
                Item 1, paragraph 2.
        <list_item>
            <paragraph>
                Item 2.

See list_item_ for another example.


``caption``
===========

`To be completed`_.


``caution``
===========

The ``caution`` element is an admonition, a distinctive and
self-contained notice.  Also see the other admonition elements
Docutils offers (in alphabetical order): attention_, danger_, error_,
hint_, important_, note_, tip_, warning_, and the generic admonition_.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``caution``.

:Children:
    ``caution`` elements contain one or more `body elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``caution`` is analogous to the DocBook "caution" element.

:Processing:
    Rendered distinctly (inset and/or in a box, etc.), with the
    generated title "Caution" (or similar).


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   (`%body.elements;`_)+

:Attributes:
    The ``caution`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%body.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``caution``.  The `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity
    indirectly includes ``caution``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText source::

    .. Caution:: Don't take any wooden nickels.

Pseudo-XML_ fragment from simple parsing::

    <caution>
        <paragraph>
            Don't take any wooden nickels.


``citation``
============

`To be completed`_.


``citation_reference``
======================

`To be completed`_.


``classifier``
==============

The ``classifier`` element contains the classification or type of the
term_ being defined in a definition_list_.  For example, it can be
used to indicate the type of a variable.


Details
-------

:Parents:
    Only the definition_list_item_ element contains ``classifier``.

:Children:
    ``classifier`` elements may contain text data plus `inline elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``classifier`` has no direct analogues in common DTDs.  It can be
    emulated with primitives or type effects.

:Processing:
    See definition_list_item_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    `%text.model;`_

:Attributes:
    The ``classifier`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.

``definition_list``
===================

The ``definition_list`` element contains a list of terms and their
definitions.  It can be used for glossaries or dictionaries, to
describe or classify things, for dialogues, or to itemize subtopics
(such as in this reference).


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

========================

The ``definition_list_item`` element contains a single
term_/definition_ pair (with optional classifier_).


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Body Subelements`_ (compound)

:Parents:
    Only the definition_list_ element contains
    ``definition_list_item``.

:Children:
    ``definition_list_item`` elements each contain a single term_,
    an optional classifier_, and a definition_.

:Analogues:
    ``definition_list_item`` is analogous to the DocBook
    "variablelistentry" element.

:Processing:
    The optional classifier_ can be rendered differently from the
    term_.  They should be separated visually, typically by spaces
    plus a colon or dash.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    (term_, classifier_?, definition_)

:Attributes:
    The ``definition_list_item`` element contains only the `common
    attributes`_: ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

``description``
===============

The ``description`` element contains body elements, describing the
purpose or effect of a command-line option or group of options.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Body Subelements`_

:Parents:
    Only the option_list_item_ element contains ``description``.

:Children:
    ``description`` elements may contain `body elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``description`` has no direct analogues in common DTDs.

:Processing:
    See option_list_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   (`%body.elements;`_)+

:Attributes:
    The ``description`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.


Examples
--------

See the examples for the option_list_ element.


``docinfo``
===========

The ``docinfo`` element is a container for document bibliographic
data, or meta-data (data about the document).  It corresponds to the
front matter of a book, such as the title page and copyright page.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Structural Subelements`_

:Parents:
    Only the document_ element contains ``docinfo``.

:Children:
    ``docinfo`` elements contain `bibliographic elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``docinfo`` is analogous to DocBook "info" elements ("bookinfo"
    etc.).  There are no directly analogous HTML elements; the "meta"
    element carries some of the same information, albeit invisibly.

:Processing:
    The ``docinfo`` element may be rendered as a two-column table or
    in other styles.  It may even be invisible or omitted from the
    processed output.  Meta-data may be extracted from ``docinfo``
    children; for example, HTML ``<meta>`` tags may be constructed.

    When Docutils_ transforms a reStructuredText_ field_list_ into a
    ``docinfo`` element (see the examples below), RCS/CVS keywords are
    normally stripped from simple (one paragraph) field bodies.  For
    complete details, please see `RCS Keywords`_ in the
    `reStructuredText Markup Specification`_.

    .. _RCS Keywords: rst/restructuredtext.html#rcs-keywords


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    (`%bibliographic.elements;`_)+

:Attributes:
    The ``docinfo`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.


Examples
--------

Docinfo is represented in reStructuredText_ by a field_list_ in a
bibliographic context: the first non-comment element of a document_,
after any document title_/subtitle_.  The field list is transformed
into a ``docinfo`` element and its children by a transform.  Source::

Note that "Filename" is a non-standard ``docinfo`` field, so becomes a
generic ``field`` element.  Also note that the "RCSfile" keyword
syntax has been stripped from the "Filename" data.

See field_list_ for an example in a non-bibliographic context.  Also
see the individual examples for the various `bibliographic elements`_.


``doctest_block``
=================

The ``doctest_block`` element is a Python-specific variant of
literal_block_.  It is a block of text where line breaks and
whitespace are significant and must be preserved.  ``doctest_block``
elements are used for interactive Python interpreter sessions, which
are distinguished by their input prompt: ``>>>``.  They are meant to
illustrate usage by example, and provide an elegant and powerful
testing environment via the `doctest module`_ in the Python standard
library.

.. _doctest module:
   http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Simple Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``doctest_block``.

:Children:
    ``doctest_block`` elements may contain text data plus `inline
    elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``doctest_block`` is analogous to the HTML "pre" element and to
    the DocBook "programlisting" and "screen" elements.

:Processing:
    As with literal_block_, ``doctest_block`` elements are typically
    rendered in a monospaced typeface.  It is crucial that all
    whitespace and line breaks are preserved in the rendered form.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   `%text.model;`_

:Attributes:
    The ``doctest_block`` element contains the `common attributes`_
    (ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_), plus `xml:space`_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%body.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``doctest_block``.  The `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity
    indirectly includes ``doctest_block``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText source::

    This is an ordinary paragraph.

    >>> print 'this is a Doctest block'
    this is a Doctest block

Pseudo-XML_ fragment from simple parsing::

    <paragraph>
        This is an ordinary paragraph.
    <doctest_block xml:space="preserve">
        >>> print 'this is a Doctest block'
        this is a Doctest block


``document``
============

The ``document`` element is the root (topmost) element of the Docutils
document tree.  ``document`` is the direct or indirect ancestor of
every other element in the tree.  It encloses the entire document
tree.  It is the starting point for a document.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Structural Elements`_

:Parents:
    The ``document`` element has no parents.

:Children:
    ``document`` elements may contain `structural subelements`_,
    `structural elements`_, and `body elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``document`` is analogous to the HTML "html" element and to
    several DocBook elements such as "book".


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    ( (title_, subtitle_?)?,
      decoration_?,
      (docinfo_, transition_?)?,
      `%structure.model;`_ )

Depending on the source of the data and the stage of processing, the
"document" may not initially contain a "title".  A document title is
not directly representable in reStructuredText_.  Instead, a lone
top-level section may have its title promoted to become the document
title_, and similarly for a lone second-level (sub)section's title to
become the document subtitle_.

The contents of "decoration_" may be specified in a document,
constructed programmatically, or both.  The "docinfo_" may be
transformed from an initial field_list_.

See the `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity for details of the body
of a ``document``.

:Attributes:
    The ``document`` element contains the `common attributes`_ (ids_,
    names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_), plus an optional title__
    attribute which stores the document title metadata.

    __ `title (attribute)`_


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

    A Title
    =======

    A paragraph.

                A Title
            <paragraph>
                A paragraph.

After applying transforms, the section title is promoted to become the
document title::

    <document ids="a-title" names="a title">
        <title>
            A Title
        <paragraph>
            A paragraph.

``enumerated_list``
===================

The ``enumerated_list`` element contains list_item_ elements which are
uniformly marked with enumerator labels.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``enumerated_list``.

:Children:
    ``enumerated_list`` elements contain one or more list_item_
    elements.

:Analogues:
    ``enumerated_list`` is analogous to the HTML "ol" element and to
    the DocBook "orderedlist" element.

:Processing:
    Each list item should begin a new vertical block, prefaced by a
    enumeration marker (such as "1.").


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    (list_item_ +)

:Attributes:
    The ``enumerated_list`` element contains the `common attributes`_
    (ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_), plus enumtype_,
    prefix_, suffix_, and start_.

    ``enumtype`` is used to record the intended enumeration sequence,
    one of "arabic" (1, 2, 3, ...), "loweralpha" (a, b, c, ..., z),
    "upperalpha" (A, B, C, ..., Z), "lowerroman" (i, ii, iii, iv, ...,
    mmmmcmxcix [4999]), or "upperroman" (I, II, III, IV, ...,
    MMMMCMXCIX [4999]).

    ``prefix`` stores the formatting characters used before the
    enumerator.  In documents originating from reStructuredText_ data,
    it will contain either "" (empty string) or "(" (left
    parenthesis).  It may or may not affect processing.

    ``suffix`` stores the formatting characters used after the
    enumerator.  In documents originating from reStructuredText_ data,
    it will contain either "." (period) or ")" (right parenthesis).
    Depending on the capabilities of the output format, this attribute
    may or may not affect processing.

    ``start`` contains the ordinal value of the first item in the
    list, in decimal.  For lists beginning at value 1 ("1", "a", "A",
    "i", or "I"), this attribute may be omitted.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%body.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``enumerated_list``.  The `%structure.model;`_ parameter entity
    indirectly includes ``enumerated_list``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

    1. Item 1.

       (A) Item A.
       (B) Item B.
       (C) Item C.

            <paragraph>
                Item 2.

See list_item_ for another example.


``error``
=========

The ``error`` element is an admonition, a distinctive and
self-contained notice.  Also see the other admonition elements
Docutils offers (in alphabetical order): attention_, caution_,
danger_, hint_, important_, note_, tip_, warning_, and the generic
admonition_.

``field``
=========

The ``field`` element contains a pair of field_name_ and field_body_
elements.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Body Subelements`_

:Parents:
    The following elements may contain ``field``: docinfo_,
    field_list_

:Children:
    Each ``field`` element contains one field_name_ and one
    field_body_ element.

:Analogues:
    ``field`` has no direct analogues in common DTDs.

:Processing:
    See field_list_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   (field_name_, field_body_)

:Attributes:
    The ``field`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%bibliographic.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``field``.


Examples
--------

See the examples for the field_list_ and docinfo_ elements.


``field_body``
==============

The ``field_body`` element contains body elements.  It is analogous to
a database field's data.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Body Subelements`_

:Parents:
    Only the field_ element contains ``field_body``.

:Children:
    ``field_body`` elements may contain `body elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``field_body`` has no direct analogues in common DTDs.

:Processing:
    See field_list_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

   (`%body.elements;`_)*

:Attributes:
    The ``field_body`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.


Examples
--------

See the examples for the field_list_ and docinfo_ elements.


``field_list``
==============

The ``field_list`` element contains two-column table-like structures
resembling database records (label & data pairs).  Field lists are
often meant for further processing.  In reStructuredText_, field lists
are used to represent bibliographic fields (contents of the docinfo_
element) and directive options.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Compound Body Elements`_

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``field_list``.

:Children:
    ``field_list`` elements contain one or more field_ elements.

:Analogues:
    ``field_list`` has no direct analogues in common DTDs.  It can be
    emulated with primitives such as tables.

:Processing:
    A ``field_list`` is typically rendered as a two-column list, where
    the first column contains "labels" (usually with a colon suffix).
    However, field lists are often used for extension syntax or
    special processing.  Such structures do not survive as field lists
    to be rendered.

                    Paragraph 4.


``sidebar``
===========

Sidebars are like miniature, parallel documents that occur inside
other documents, providing related or reference material.  A
``sidebar`` is typically offset by a border and "floats" to the side
of the page; the document's main text may flow around it.  Sidebars
can also be likened to super-footnotes; their content is outside of
the flow of the document's main text.

The ``sidebar`` element is a nonrecursive section_-like construct
which may occur at the top level of a section_ wherever a body element
(list, table, etc.) is allowed.  In other words, ``sidebar`` elements
cannot nest inside body elements, so you can't have a ``sidebar``
inside a ``table`` or a ``list``, or inside another ``sidebar`` (or
topic_).


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Structural Elements`_

:Parents:
    The following elements may contain ``sidebar``: document_,
    section_

:Children:
    ``sidebar`` elements begin with a title_ and an optional subtitle_
    and contain `body elements`_ and topic_ elements.

:Analogues:
    ``sidebar`` is analogous to the DocBook "sidebar" element.

:Processing:
    A ``sidebar`` element should be set off from the rest of the
    document somehow, typically with a border.  Sidebars typically
    "float" to the side of the page and the document's main text flows
    around them.

``transition``
==============

The ``transition`` element is commonly seen in novels and short
fiction, as a gap spanning one or more lines, with or without a type
ornament such as a row of asterisks.  Transitions separate body
elements and sections, dividing a section into untitled divisions.  A
transition may not begin or end a section [#]_ or document, nor may
two transitions be immediately adjacent.

See `Doctree Representation of Transitions`__ in `A Record of
reStructuredText Syntax Alternatives`__.

.. [#] In reStructuredText markup, a transition may appear to fall at
   the end of a section immediately before another section.  A
   transform recognizes this case and moves the transition so it
   separates the sections.

``version``
===========

The ``version`` element contains the version number of the document.
It can be used alone or in conjunction with revision_.


Details
-------

:Category:
    `Bibliographic Elements`_

:Parents:
    Only the docinfo_ element contains ``version``.

:Children:
    ``version`` elements may contain text data plus `inline
    elements`_.

:Analogues:
    ``version`` may be considered analogous to the DocBook "revision",
    "revnumber", or "biblioid" elements.

:Processing:
    Sometimes used with the RCS/CVS keyword "Revision".  See docinfo_
    and revision_.


Content Model
-------------

.. parsed-literal::

    `%text.model;`_

:Attributes:
    The ``version`` element contains only the `common attributes`_:
    ids_, names_, dupnames_, source_, and classes_.

:Parameter Entities:
    The `%bibliographic.elements;`_ parameter entity directly includes
    ``version``.


Examples
--------

reStructuredText_ source::

    Document Title
    ==============

    :Version: 1.1

            <version>
                1.1

See docinfo_ for a more complete example, including processing
context.


``warning``
===========

The ``warning`` element is an admonition, a distinctive and
self-contained notice.  Also see the other admonition elements
Docutils offers (in alphabetical order): attention_, caution_,
danger_, error_, hint_, important_, note_, tip_.

:Parents:
    All elements employing the `%body.elements;`_ or
    `%structure.model;`_ parameter entities in their content models
    may contain ``warning``.

:Children:
    ``warning`` elements contain one or more `body elements`_.

:Analogues:

 Attribute Reference
---------------------

.. contents:: :local:
              :depth: 1

_`Common Attributes`: Through the `%basic.atts;`_ parameter entity,
all elements contain the following attributes: ids_, names_, dupnames_,
source_, and classes_.

.. _attribute type:

Attribute types:

``CDATA``
    Character data.  ``CDATA`` attributes may contain arbitrary text.

``ID``
    Like a ``NMTOKEN``, but it must begin with a letter (a "name
    production").  Identical ``ID`` values must not appear more than
    once in a document; i.e., ID values must uniquely identify their
    elements.

``IDREF``
    A reference to an ``ID`` value (a name production) of another
    element.

``IDREFS``
    One or more space-separated ``ID`` references (name productions).

``NMTOKEN``
    A "name token".  One or more of letters, digits, ".", "-", and
    "_".

``NMTOKENS``
    One or more space-separated ``NMTOKEN`` names.

``%yesorno;``
    No if zero ("0"), yes if any other value.  This is a parameter
    entity which resolves to a ``NMTOKEN`` attribute type.

``%number;``
    This emphasizes that the attribute value must be a number.  This
    is a parameter entity which resolves to a ``NMTOKEN`` attribute
    type.

enumeration
    The attribute value may be one of a specified list of values.


``anonymous``
=============

`Attribute type`_: ``%yesorno;``.  Default value: none (implies no).

The ``anonymous`` attribute is used for unnamed hyperlinks in the
target_ and reference_ elements (via the `%anonymous.att;`_ parameter
entity).


``auto``
========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``auto`` attribute is used to indicate automatically-numbered
footnote_, footnote_reference_ and title_ elements (via the
`%auto.att;`_ parameter entity).


``backrefs``
============

`Attribute type`_: ``IDREFS``.  Default value: none.

The ``backrefs`` attribute contains a space-separated list of ids_
references, used for backlinks from footnote_, citation_, and
system_message_ elements (via the `%backrefs.att;`_ parameter entity).


``bullet``
==========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``bullet`` attribute is used in the bullet_list_ element.


``classes``
===========

`Attribute type`_: ``NMTOKENS``.  Default value: none.

The ``classes`` attribute is a list containing one or more names used
to classify an element.  The purpose of the attribute is to indicate
an "is-a" variant relationship, to allow an extensible way of defining
sub-classes of existing elements.  It can be used to carry context
forward between a Docutils Reader and Writer, when a custom structure
is reduced to a standardized document tree.  One common use is in
conjunction with stylesheets, to add selection criteria.  It should
not be used to carry formatting instructions or arbitrary content.

The ``classes`` attribute's contents should be ignorable.  Writers that
are not familiar with the variant expressed should be able to ignore
the attribute.

``classes`` is one of the `common attributes`_, shared by all Docutils
elements.


``delimiter``
=============

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``delimiter`` attribute is used in the option_argument_ element.


``dupnames``
============

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``dupnames`` attribute is a list containing the names of an
element when there has been a naming conflict.  The contents of the
``dupnames`` attribute would have been transferred from the `names`_
attribute.  An element may have at most one of the ``names`` or
``dupnames`` attributes, but not both.  ``dupnames`` is one of the
`common attributes`_, shared by all Docutils elements.


``enumtype``
============

`Attribute type`_: enumeration, one of "arabic", "loweralpha",
"upperalpha", "lowerroman", or "upperroman".  Default value: none.

The ``enumtype`` attribute is used in the enumerated_list_ element.


``ids``
=======

`Attribute type`_: ``NMTOKENS``.  Default value: none.

The ``ids`` attribute is a list containing one or more unique
identifier keys.  ``ids`` is one of the `common attributes`_, shared
by all Docutils elements.


``names``
=========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``names`` attribute is a list containing the names of an element,
typically originating from the element's title or content.  Each name
in ``names`` must be unique; if there are name conflicts (two or more
elements want to the same name), the contents will be transferred to
the `dupnames`_ attribute on the duplicate elements.  An element may
have at most one of the ``names`` or ``dupnames`` attributes, but not
both.  ``names`` is one of the `common attributes`_, shared by all
Docutils elements.


``prefix``
==========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``prefix`` attribute is used in the enumerated_list_ element.


``refid``
=========

`Attribute type`_: ``IDREF``.  Default value: none.

The ``refid`` attribute contains references to `ids`_ attributes in
other elements.  It is used by the target_, reference_,
footnote_reference_, citation_reference_, title_ and problematic_
elements (via the `%refid.att;`_ and `%reference.atts;`_ parameter
entities).


``refname``
===========

`Attribute type`_: ``NMTOKENS``.  Default value: none.

The ``refname`` attribute contains an internal reference to the
`names`_ attribute of another element.  On a `target`_ element,
``refname`` indicates an indirect target which may resolve to either
an internal or external reference.  ``refname`` is used by the
target_, reference_, footnote_reference_, citation_reference_, and
substitution_reference_ elements (via the `%refname.att;`_ and
`%reference.atts;`_ parameter entities).


``refuri``
==========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``refuri`` attribute contains an external reference to a URI/URL.
It is used by the target_, reference_, footnote_reference_, and
citation_reference_ elements (via the `%reference.atts;`_ parameter
entity).


``source``
==========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``source`` attribute is used to store the path or URL to the
source text that was used to produce the document tree.  It is one of
the `common attributes`_, shared by all Docutils elements.


``start``
=========

`Attribute type`_: ``%number;``.  Default value: none.

The ``start`` attribute is used in the enumerated_list_ element.


``suffix``
==========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``suffix`` attribute is used in the enumerated_list_ element.


``xml:space``
=============

`Attribute type`_: one of "default" or "preserve".  Default value:
"preserve" (fixed).

The ``xml:space`` attribute is a standard XML attribute for
whitespace-preserving elements.  It is used by the literal_block_,
line_block_, doctest_block_, comment_, and raw_ elements (via the
`%fixedspace.att;`_ parameter entity).  It is a fixed attribute, meant
to communicate to an XML parser that the element contains significant
whitespace.  The attribute value should not be set in a document
instance.


.. _title (attribute):

``title``
=========

`Attribute type`_: ``CDATA``.  Default value: none.

The ``title`` attribute stores the title metadata of a document.  This
title is typically not part of the rendered document.  It may for
example be used in HTML's ``title`` element.
