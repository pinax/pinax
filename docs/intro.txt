Introduction
============

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the `Django Web Framework`_.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things
that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your
site different.

While our initial development was focused around a demo social
networking site, Pinax is suitable for a wide variety of websites. We
are working on number of editions tailored to intranets, event
management, learning management, software project management and more.

At this stage, there is:

- openid support

- user-to-user messaging
