Installation
============

Pinax has not yet had its first formal release so the code is only available
via Subversion::

    svn checkout http://svn.pinaxproject.com/pinax/trunk/ pinax

Pinax takes a batteries-included approach so that checkout (which includes
a lot of svn:externals for third-party apps and libraries used) will almost
work out of the box. The one exception is the `Python Imaging Library`_ (PIL)
which you will have to provide yourself if you want photo support.

Note that if you already have an external app or external library on the path,
you don't need to use the one we provide.

Once the checkout is complete, you should be able to cd into
``projects/complete_project/`` or ``projects/basic_project/`` and run 
``./manage.py syncdb`` and ``./manage.py runserver`` to get running immediately.

These are just sample projects, however. You will likely want to create your
own project and :ref:`customize <ref-customization>` it.


Directory Structure
-------------------

::

  projects/
    complete_project/   contains a complete sample project and templates
    basic_project/      a more basic starter project
  apps/
    external_apps/      contains external re-usable apps via svn:externals
    local_apps/         contains re-usable apps that aren't yet externalized
  libs/
    external_libs/      contains external libraries
  docs/                 documentation (using rst and sphinx; in progress)
  fixtures/             test fixtures (in progress)


There is some path manipulation in manage.py to get this all to work. You'll
need to do something similar in your wsgi or mod_python configuration. See
:ref:`ref-deployment` for more details.

Note To Windows Users
---------------------

You have to make one small change for Pinax to work on Windows due to the
lack of symbolic links.

Go to the ``libs/external_libs/gdata.py-1.0.13`` directory and move
``src/atom`` to ``atom`` and ``src/gdata`` to ``gdata`` (i.e. move
them both up one folder)
