Customization
=============

As more sites are built using Pinax, more best practices will emerge, but for
now what we recommend is:

- Choose which :ref:`project <ref-project>` you would like to use as a starting 
  point.
- Copy that project into a directory outside of the subversion checkout.
- Make necessary changes to the ``settings.py`` and ``urls.py`` files in your
  copied directory.
- Ensure ``PINAX_ROOT`` is setup correctly in your settings. It should point
  to where Pinax lives on your filesystem.
- Change the domain and display name of the Site in the admin interface. 
- Develop your custom apps under your new project or anywhere on Python path.
- Develop your own templates under your new project.

Choosing a Project
------------------

By default, Pinax provides two projects to use as a starting point for 
customization.  Depending on your development style, you may prefer one project 
over the other.

basic_project
    This project comes with the bare minimum set of applications and templates
    to get you started.  It includes no extra tabs--only the profile and notices 
    tabs are included by default. From here you can add any extra functionality 
    and applications that you would like.

complete_project
    This project comes fully-featured, with everything that Pinax provides
    enabled by default.  It provides all tabs available, etc.  From here you can
    remove applications that you do not want to use, and add your own 
    applications as well.


Settings You Will (Probably) Want To Override
---------------------------------------------

- ``PINAX_ROOT``
- ``DEBUG``
- ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``
- ``LOGGING_OUTPUT_ENABLED``
- ``ADMINS``
- ``MANAGERS``
- ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
- ``DATABASE_NAME``
- ``DATABASE_USER``
- ``DATABASE_PASSWORD``
- ``DATABASE_HOST``
- ``DATABASE_PORT``
- ``TIME_ZONE``
- ``SECRET_KEY``
- ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``
- ``SERVER_EMAIL``
- ``MAILER_PAUSE_SEND``
- ``SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS``
- ``EMAIL_HOST``
- ``EMAIL_PORT``
- ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``
- ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``
- ``EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX``
- ``EMAIL_DEBUG``
- ``CONTACT_EMAIL``
- ``URCHIN_ID``
- ``BBAUTH_APP_ID``
- ``BBAUTH_SHARED_SECRET``
- ``SITE_NAME``

All but ``MAILER_PAUSE_SEND``, ``CONTACT_EMAIL``, ``URCHIN_ID``,
``BBAUTH_APP_ID``, ``BBAUTH_SHARED_SECRET`` and ``SITE_NAME`` are just the
standard Django settings.


``base.html`` versus ``site_base.html``
---------------------------------------

In the sample projects, ``templates/base.html`` is intended for overall page structure
whereas ``templates/site_base.html`` is intended for adding site-specific content that
is to be found on all pages (things like logo, navigation or footers).

If you are writing a theme to be used across multiple sites, you should modify
``base.html``, not ``site_base.html``. If you want to keep a particular theme
but modify content for a specific site, you should modify ``site_base.html``.


Adding Tabs
