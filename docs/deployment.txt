Deployment
==========

In short:

* Create a ``local_settings.py`` alongside ``settings.py`` for your
  host-specific settings (like database connection, e-mail, etc).
* Configure mod_wsgi.
* Set up ``cron`` job for mailer and asynchronous notifications.

Using mod_wsgi
--------------

If you are using mod_wsgi, which we recommend, you will need to provide a WSGI
script. All projects include a ``deploy/`` directory which contain this
script named ``wsgi.py``. You may modify this file to best suit your needs.

Here is a basic configuration for Apache (assuming you are using Python 2.5)::

    WSGIDaemonProcess mysite python-path=/path/to/virtualenvs/pinax-env/lib/python2.5/site-packages
    WSGIProcessGroup mysite
    
    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/project/deploy/wsgi.py
    <Directory /path/to/project/deploy>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

The above configuration will likely need to be modified before use. Most
specifically make sure the ``python-path`` option points to the right Python
version. We encourage you to read about `WSGIDaemonProcess`_ to learn more
about what you can configure.

.. _ref-sending-mail-and-notices:

Sending Mail and Notices
------------------------

Both mail messages and (some) notifications are queued for asynchronous
delivery. To actually deliver them you need to run::
    
    python manage.py send_mail
    
and::
    
    python manage.py emit_notices
    
on a frequent, regular basis.

Because failed mail will be deferred, you need an additional, less
frequent, run of::
    
    python manage.py retry_deferred
    
We recommend setting up some scripts to run these commands within your
virtual environment. You can use the following shell script as the basis for
each management command::

    #!/bin/sh

    WORKON_HOME=/home/user/virtualenvs
    PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/project

    # activate virtual environment
    . $WORKON_HOME/pinax-env/bin/activate

    cd $PROJECT_ROOT
    python manage.py send_mail >> $PROJECT_ROOT/logs/cron_mail.log 2>&1

Let's assume the scripts you create from above are stored in
``$PROJECT_ROOT/cron``. You can now setup the cron job similar to::
    
    * * * * * /path/to/project/cron/send_mail.sh
    * * * * * /path/to/project/cron/emit_notices.sh
    
    0,20,40 * * * * /path/to/project/cron/retry_deferred.sh

This runs ``send_mail`` and ``emit_notices`` every minute and
``retry_deferred`` every 20 minutes.

Media files
-----------

Pinax makes it very easy to combine all your applications' media files into
one single location (see :ref:`ref-media` for details). Serving them more or
less comes down again to how you do it with Django itself.

There is an example on how to serve those files with the development server in
:ref:`ref-media-devel`.

In a production environment you, too, have to merge those files before you can
serve them. Regarding actually serving those files then, see `Django's
deployment documentation`_ for details.
